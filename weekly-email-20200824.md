## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Join Us for ERCAP Office Hours Starting this Thursday! <a name="ercapofficehrs"/></a> 

Allocations staff will once again hold virtual office hours via Zoom to assist
users with finishing up and submitting their ERCAP requests, on the following
dates:
- Thursday, August 27
- Thursday, September 3
- Thursday, September 17
- Thursday, October 1
- Monday, October 5 (ERCAP due date)

This Thursday's office hours will take place from 9-11 am and 2-4 pm (Pacific
time). Please join the Zoom meeting via [this link](https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/7314990879?pwd=Z1B6UnRjaEVSeFNUb1hCSUFTWjE2dz09),

### Join IDEAS-ECP for Thursday Panel on How to Make Teams Tick <a name="remwk"/></a> 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for many to transition to 
unplanned remote work, the IDEAS-ECP Productivity project launched the panel 
series *Strategies for Working Remotely*, which explores important topics in 
this area. The next panel discussion in the series is titled "How to Make Teams
Tick", and will be held this Thursday, August 27, from noon to 1:15 PM (Pacific
time).

**Abstract:** Many teams have been working remotely for several months as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, teams were largely co-located 
and comfortable that way -- they just seemed to tick. Now that teams have become
fully virtual and can no longer rely on productivity practices driven by being 
face-to-face, how have they managed change? What personal challenges have they 
faced, and how are they bringing back into balance team dynamics and individual 
well-being? What are they learning about themselves and each other that has been
unexpected? In the fifth installment of this IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, 
we take a deeper dive and bring together members of successful software teams, 
Sierra and Portage, to speak candidly about being disrupted by change and 
bringing their teams back into balance. Panelists will make brief introductory 
comments followed by open discussion. 

Register for this free event at the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) panel 
series website: <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/teamproductivity/>.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### NUG Meeting Slides and Livestream Available <a name="nugmtg"/></a> 

Last Monday's NERSC User Group Annual Meeting was livestreamed. If you missed
part of the meeting or wanted to take a look at some of it, you can peruse the 
slides or watch the recorded livestream.

This year's theme was Perlmutter, which is arriving at the very end of this 
year. Learn about the features and capabilities of the system, plus our plans 
for software and services, resources for getting your applications running on 
the GPUs, and how and when users will be able to access the machine. Breakout
sessions were held on topics such as AI and deep learning on Perlmutter, ERCAP
and Iris tricks and tips, application performance portability, and experimental
data best practices. User talks on their experiences and scientific results were
featured in a round of lightning talks.

For the slides, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/annual-meetings/nug-2020/>.
The [raw livestream video](https://youtu.be/Bj-BMomoZfo) is available on the 
NERSC YouTube channel.


### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Is Open! <a name="ercap"/></a> 

The ERCAP allocations process has now begun accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY). Requests will be accepted through Monday, October 5, 2020.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen 
to [this podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l). 

Please join us for virtual [office hours](#ercapofficehrs), the first of which 
will take place this Thursday.

## Calls for Participation <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Submit a Paper to the Interactive HPC 2020 Workshop <a name="interactivehpc"/></a> 

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent 
HPC-based workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.
The real-time QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and
observational data workloads. Jupyter has become a major point of entry and 
platform for interactive ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd 
like to share with the world? Then please consider submitting a paper to the 
Fourth Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020. 
Position papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome
(up to 10 pages). The workshop itself will be held virtually on November 11, 12,
or 13, in conjunction with SuperComputing 2020.
For more details on the workshop, including submission instructions, please see:
<https://www.interactivehpc.com/>.


### Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Now Open! <a name="bssw"/></a> 

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### CUDA Training Series Concludes on September 17 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The ninth and final training in the series, to be held Thursday, September 17, 
covers cooperative groups -- a flexible model for thread synchronization both
within and across thread blocks, which enables the writing of a wide range of
parallel algorithms in a composable and well-defined manner.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cooperative-groups-part-9-of-9-cuda-training-series-september-17-2020/>.


### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Testing & Code Review Practices in Research Software Development on September 9 <a name="ecpwebinar"/></a> 

The September webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Testing and Code Review Practices in Research Software 
Development" and will take place on Wednesday, September 9, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Nasir Eisty (California Polytechnic State University,
San Luis Obispo), will cover the use of two software quality practices in the
development of research software: software testing and peer code review. These
practices can lead to not only improved scientific results through higher 
quality software in the short term, but also more maintainable software in the 
long term. Learn about the challenges, barriers, and necessary improvements to
make the practices effective for research software development, based on studies
of the research software community conducted via interviews, surveys, workshops,
and tutorials.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://exascaleproject.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIscu-rpz8tHSl-MeswznBzjweQ4c9fR2s).
