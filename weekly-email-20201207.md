## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Shelter-in-Place Impacts <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under a
shelter-in-place order.
NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support but no 
telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Join Us for a Training on NVIDIA HPC SDK, Tomorrow & Thursday <a name="nvidiatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA will present a two-part training series for NERSC and OLCF users about
using OpenMP target offload with NVIDIA's HPC SDK compilers. The training will
introduce OpenMP target offload, the NVIDIA compilers, and best practices for 
achieving high performance with OpenMP target offload on NVIDIA GPUs. Access to
Cori GPU nodes will be provided.

The trainings will be held tomorrow and Thursday, December 8 and 10, and
presented online only using Zoom.

For more information and to register, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/nvidia-hpcsdk-openmp-target-offload-training-december-2020/>.


### Join us for a TotalView Training, This Wednesday, December 9! <a name="tvtutorial"/></a> 

NERSC will host a half-day training event on the TotalView debugger this 
Wednesday, December 9, 2020. In this training, users will learn how to use one 
of the most popular parallel GUI debugging tools in identifying and fixing 
errors in parallel codes on CPUs and GPUs. The presenters will also provide the
latest updates on TotalView features that can further enhance your debugging 
experience.

The training will be presented online, using Zoom.

For the agenda and registration, please see

### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Software Design for Longevity with Performance Portability on December 9 <a name="ecpwebinar"/></a> 

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Software Design for Longevity with Performance Portability"
and will take place this Wednesday, December 9, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Anshu Dubey (Argonne National Laboratory), will
discuss the challenges of designing software that reconciles the cross purposes
of performance portability and longevity, and present a few basic principles of 
scientific software design that have been instrumental in mitigating some of the
challenges that application developers are facing. These principles represent a
combination of experience from the presenter's own project and from the ECP
Performance Portability panel series over the summer.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://exascaleproject.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIsf-CgqDwvE-qCex26LYy1YwhOEkhxHCE).


### Don't Forget -- Let NERSC Know How We're Doing via the NERSC User Survey! <a name="usersurvey"/></a> 

NERSC has once again retained an external company, National Business Research 
Institute, to perform our Allocation Year 2020 survey. A personalized invitation
to take the survey was emailed to each user on Thursday, November 19, and a
reminder was sent this morning.

Please take the survey to let NERSC know how we're doing, and what we can do
better to serve you.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Cori Default Python Modules Changing on December 21 <a name="pythonmodules"/></a> 

On December 21, 2020, we will change Cori's default Python module 
(python/3.7-anaconda-2019.10) to a newer version (python/3.8-anaconda-2020.11). 
What does this mean for you?

The new module features new versions and software: 
- Python 3.8
- Conda 4.9.2
- Mamba 0.1.2 (faster alternative to Conda).

There are a few things to be aware of when using the new Python module:
- Pip-installed packages (via `--user`) are tied to the previous default module 
and will need to be reinstalled to be used with the new module.
    - In the new module, you will need to reinstall pip packages installed via 
      `--user`
    - More info is available here: <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/nersc-python/#installing-libraries-via-pip>
- Conda environments will require few changes.
    - You can still launch old environments from the new module
    - If you use `conda init` to write to your `.bashrc` file, you may consider 
deleting these lines and re-running `conda init`
    - More info is available here: <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/nersc-python/#option-3-conda-init-conda-activate>

Please open a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov> with any questions.


### (NEW) Schedule for December 15-20 Full-Facility Power Outage <a name="powerupgrade"/></a> 

The final power upgrade for the Perlmutter installation will take place
December 15-20. During most of this time, power will be cut to the building 
where NERSC is housed.

**All NERSC resources -- systems and services alike -- except for the main NERSC
website and the documentation website will be unavailable for all or part of the
outage.** (These two websites are hosted off-site and have no dependencies 
within the NERSC machine room.)

Here is a brief timeline of what to expect (all times Pacific):
- **7:00 am, Tuesday, December 15: NERSC starts to bring down systems.**
    - On Cori, a reservation will prevent any jobs from running past 7:00 am, 
and at that time the login nodes will be made unavailable to users and powered 
down.
    - All other systems, including all file systems, HPSS, Spin, Iris, and LDAP 
(authentication) will begin to be systematically turned off. 
- **1:00 pm, Tuesday, December 15: All resources are shut down.**
    - Because the NERSC help site requires LDAP authentication to be used,
NERSC consultants and account support specialists will lose access to the
system. (This may happen earlier than, but no later than, 1 pm.) *NERSC 
consulting and account support will not be operational for the duration of the 
outage.*
- **Wednesday, December 16 - 5:00 pm, Friday December 18 (approximately): Power
subsystems testing and upgrade.**
    - Electrical systems testing and upgrades will take place. NERSC cannot
have any systems powered up on a generator for a portion of the work, to ensure
safety and thorough testing.
- **Friday evening, December 18: Power is restored and NERSC begins bringing up
systems.**
    - NERSC's network and associated security systems will be the first to come 
online. Then we will begin to bring up all systems except Cori.
    - Cori will undergo a maintenance which includes extensive work on its
scratch file system, to put a permanent fix in place for the issues we 
encountered in late September/early October.
- **Saturday morning, December 19: All systems and services (except Cori) are
restored.**
    - Following the restoration of the network, most systems can be restarted in
parallel, with a few exceptions. We expect that Iris will return to full
service at this point, and any system or service with a dependence on Cori or 
Cori scratch will be degraded or remain unavailable.
- **Sunday, December 20: Before the end of the day, we anticipate that the 
scratch maintenance will complete and Cori will be returned to users.**
    - At this point, NERSC will once again be fully operational.


### File Purging on Cori Scratch Has Resumed <a name="scratchpurge"/></a> 

During the period of unstable scratch performance that began in late September, 
NERSC temporarily suspended the purging of the Cori scratch file system 
(CSCRATCH) to help preserve the state of user files while the metadata was being
rebuilt.

Now that the file system issue has been debugged and corrected, we have resumed
regularly scheduled purging of files whose last access time was over twelve
weeks ago, per our 
[scratch purge policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/quotas/#purging).

File purging is a tool NERSC uses to clean up unwanted files and improve the
performance of the file system. Performance decreases as a file system becomes
very full. The file system is over 80% full as of this writing and its 
performance will begin to deteriorate if no action is taken. **Please remember
that this process benefits everyone by keeping a performant scratch file system
available for users, and do not attempt to circumvent the purge process.**

Assistance in migrating files from CSCRATCH to another location is available via
a [ticket](https://help.nersc.gov), and 
[quota increases](https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/quotas/#increases) on HPSS 
and the Community File System (CFS) are also available, should you need more 
space on non-purged storage resources.


### NERSC Help Portal Is Now Default <a name="helpportal"/></a> 

NERSC's new help portal is now the default for 
[help.nersc.gov](https://help.nersc.gov). The previous interface will continue 
to remain available via the "classic view" button.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Join December 17 ECP Tutorial on Scientific Visualization & Analysis Using Alpine Ascent <a name="ecptutorial"/></a> 

Are you looking for a visualization solution that does not require you to wait
for a post-processing phase to visualize your data? Do you want a solution
unconstrained by the gaps between I/O and compute speeds, that can leverage the
compute resources allocated to your existing simulation? If so, consider
registering for the December 17 tutorial on using Alpine Ascent, sponsored
by the ECP project.

Ascent, one of the infrastructure thrusts of the ECP ALPINE Software Technology
Project, aims to do just that. It supports production of in-memory 
visualizations for HPC simulations by leveraging both distributed-memory and 
many-core parallelism to provide ray-tracing, contouring, and more, using the
same HPC resources as its host simulation application.

The December 17 Tutorial will teach you how to present data to Ascent, and how
to transform data, render pictures, and export results. Attendees can follow
along and execute tutorial examples using cloud-hosted jupyter notebooks or a
public Ascent installation. For more information and to register, please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/ascent-201217/>.
