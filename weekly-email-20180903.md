## 2019 ERCAP Call for Proposals Opens Tomorrow <a name="ercap"/> ##

NERSC will open the 2019 ERCAP Proposal season tomorrow, Wednesday, September 5.
We have updated and improved the form based on extensive user feedback. For
consideration of your request before the new allocation year begins, please
apply before October 15.

Further details will be provided in an email to users tomorrow.


## Multi-Factor Authentication Required for Allocation Year 2019 <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In a recent email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that 
NERSC will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems
in the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Many users have experience with a variety of different MFA methods, for example 
when logging into their bank or favorite shopping website, or accessing their 
email. In some cases, access to a phone capable of receiving texts is required.
**The NERSC MFA implementation does not require these types of services to be
available, nor does it require an internet connection to generate a one-time
password.**

The simplest MFA method for most users will be to use Google Authenticator via 
their smartphone or tablet. For users without a device, alternatives are
available, including Authy for desktop and using a Yubikey token. Please stay 
tuned for more information on MFA, as we roll out even more services in the 
upcoming weeks.


## FICUS Call for Proposals (JGI/NERSC/KBase Joint Call) <a name="ficus"/> ##

The 2019 FICUS JGI-NERSC-KBase Biological Data Science call for proposals is 
open. Users will be given access to resources and capabilities through two DOE
Office of Science User Facilities -- the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and NERSC 
-- as well as the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase). The call aims to
help users perform large-scale computational analyses of genomics and related
omics data to solve problems relevant to the DOE missions in bioenergy and the
environment.

For more information and to apply, please see
<https://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/ficus-jgi-nersc/>. 
Proposals are due September 13, 2018.


## Parallel Data Storage & Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems Workshop Call for Submissions Now Open <a name="pdsw"/> ##

The Joint International Workshop on Parallel Data Storage and Data Intensive 
Scalable Computing Systems (PDSW-DISCS'18) is accepting submissions for short 
papers and work-in-progress abstracts related to addressing challenges in 
high-performance parallel I/O, data management, and experimental and 
observational data.  Special attention will be given to issues in which 
community collaboration can be crucial for problem identification, workload 
capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared 
tools.

The workshop will be held on November 12, 2018 in conjunction with SC18.  For 
more information on guidelines and relevant topic areas, see 
<http://www.pdsw.org/index.shtml>.  Short paper submissions were due September 
2, and work-in-progress abstracts are due November 1.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Software Development Best Practices <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, NERSC Infrastructure Services Group's 
Gabor Torok discusses best practices for software development, what kinds of
skills are important for an effective software engineer, and how he went from
scientific illustrator to software engineer at NERSC!

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Software-Development-Best-Practices--Gabor-Torok-Interview-e2567t>.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.
