## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During Shelter-in-Place Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in a city and county in 
California that remain under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order. Under this 
Order, only essential businesses may remain open. NERSC is considered an 
essential business due to its national importance, so we remain in operation,
but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or 
postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will 
continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could 
result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## This Week's Events & Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Submit Proposal Before Sunday for July NERSC Online Virtual Hackathon <a name="gpuhackathon"/></a> 

NERSC, in conjunction with NVIDIA and OLCF, will host a GPU Hackathon in July as
part of NVIDIA's annual [GPU Hackathon Series](https://gpuhackathons.org/)! 
The event will take place online only, with an opening day on July 7 and the
main event from July 13-15, 2020.

This year, the hackathon is going digital. Hack with world-class mentors from
the safety of your home or office!

Teams should consist of three or more developers who are intimately familiar 
with (some part of) their application, and they will work alongside two mentors 
with GPU programming expertise. If you want/need to get your code running (or 
optimized) on a GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer a unique 
opportunity to set aside 4 days, surround yourself with experts in the field, 
and push toward your development goals.  This week's NERSC User News 
[podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/GPU-Hackathons-Kevin-Gott-Interview-edsv5u/a-a25lhon)
is an additional source of information on how the hackathons are organized and
the benefits of participation.

For more information, or to submit a short proposal form, please visit the GPU 
Hackathons event page: 
<https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/nersc-gpu-hackathon> 
or NERSC's event page:
<https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/nersc-gpuhackathon>.

**Please note the deadline to submit a proposal is May 17th, 2020.** If you have
any questions, please feel free to contact Kevin Gott (kngott@lbl.gov).


### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Accelerating Numerical Libraries with Multi-Precision Algorithms on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/></a> 

The May webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Accelerating Numerical Software Libraries with Multi-Precision
algorithms", and will take place this Wednesday, May 13, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Hartwig Anzt (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) and
Piotr Luszczek (University of Tennessee), will explain how low-precision,
high-speed special function units in modern processors can be leveraged to
create fast numerical libraries for production computing.

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/multprec/>.


### CUDA Training Series Continues this Wednesday <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The fifth training in the series covers CUDA atomics, reductions, and warp 
shuffle. These operations can help you in cases where exposing parallelism is
not immediately obvious due to potential thread contention.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. As this
module's exercises are expected to take longer than the allocated time, an 
additional session to walk through the exercises has been scheduled for Monday,
May 19.

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-atomics-reductions-and-warp-shuffle-part-5-of-9-cuda-training-series/>.

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- June 18: 6. [Managed Memory](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/managed-memory-part-6-of-9-cuda-training-series-june-18-2020/)
- July 21: 7. [CUDA Concurrency](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-concurrency-part-7-of-9-cuda-training-series-july-21-2020/)

**Please note that this Slack workspace is not an official NERSC staff-supported
platform.** While NERSC staff may sometimes join the NERSC Users Slack, the
best way to reach NERSC is still through the online help desk at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


### Share Your Research, Images, Movies, and Journal Covers with NERSC! <a name="share"/></a> 

NERSC is always looking for stories, images, movies, and journal cover stories 
related to research conducted at NERSC. Please tell us about your research using
the [NERSC Science Highlights Submission Form](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlight-submit/) 
and we could feature your work in our [news stories](https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/science-news/), 
[science highlight presentations](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlights-presentations/), 
and/or other NERSC presentations and reports.


### VTune Profiler Default Upgraded to 2020 & All Older Versions Deprecated <a name="vtune"/></a> 

Last month, the Intel VTune profiler version default was upgraded to 
version 2020. Version 2020 includes significant upgrades in functionality and 
performance, and changes the names of the executables to simpler and 
easier-to-understand strings.

While the older versions (2018.up3 and 2019.up3) remain on Cori, we
encourage you to upgrade your workflow to `vtune/2020`. The deprecated versions
will no longer collect performance data, but can continue to be used to read
and analyze existing performance data that was collected with these tools.

For more information on using VTune at NERSC, please see the NERSC VTune 
documentation page at
<https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/performance-debugging-tools/vtune/>.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Register Now for May 21 Online Hands-On Training on Variable-Time Jobs! <a name="vtjobstrain"/></a> 

NERSC will host a two-hour, online hands-on user training on variable-time jobs
on Thursday, May 21, from 10:00 am to noon (Pacific time). The training begins
with a 30-minute presentation, followed by a 90-minute hands-on session.

Variable-time jobs can greatly improve queue turnaround by automatically 
exploiting opportunities for backfill in Slurm, allowing the job to start sooner
than it would otherwise. Applications need to be capable of checkpoint/restart,
either through application-level checkpointing or via external checkpointing
tools (e.g., DMTCP).

For more information and to register, please see:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/online-hands-on-user-training-on-variable-time-jobs-on-thursday-may-21-2020/>.


### Registration Open for ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools Tutorial on June 25 <a name="armtools"/></a> 

Registration is now open for the ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools (DDT, MAP and
Performance Reports) Tutorial that will be held on Thursday, June 25. Attendees
will learn how to efficiently use these popular GUI parallel debugging and 
profiling tools on Cori to analyze and improve the functionality and performance
of their codes.

The training will be presented online only, using Zoom technology.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/arm-debugging-and-profiling-tools-tutorial-june-25-2020/> for the agenda and to register.


### Register Now for UPC++ Webinar on May 27 <a name="upcpp"/></a> 

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this webinar, hosted by DOE's Exascale Computing Project and the ALCF, we 
will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization techniques of UPC++. We 
will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and walk through basic 
algorithm implementations. We will also look at irregular applications and show 
how they can take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize their performance.

This training will be held on May 27 from 9 am to noon Pacific.
The training is free but registration is required. For more information and to
register, please see <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/alcf-ecp-upc-webinar/>.


### Registration Open for New User Training on June 10 <a name="newusertrain"/></a> 

Registration is now open for the NERSC New User Training that will be held 
online on Wednesday, June 10.

The purpose of the training is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on 
our computational systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, 
tools, and best practices; and data ecosystem.

**The training will be presented online only**, using Zoom technology.

Please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/new-user-training-june-10-2020/>
for the agenda and to register. 


### OpenACC Training Series Continues May 28 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

NVIDIA will present a 
[3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **All training sessions will be online 
only.**

The May training covers data management in OpenACC. For more information and to
register, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/openacc-data-management-part-2-of-3-openacc-training-series-may-28-2020/>.
