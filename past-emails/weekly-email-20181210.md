## MFA Office Hours: this Tuesday, Next Tuesday, and Early January <a name="mfaofficehrs"/> ##

The use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access NERSC resources will
become mandatory on Tuesday, January 8, 2019. We encourage users to get a head
start to iron out any wrinkles ahead of time.

NERSC will be holding virtual office hours via Zoom from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm
(Pacific time), to assist users with this transition, on the following dates:
- Tuesday, December 11, 2018
- Tuesday, December 18, 2018
- Friday, January 4, 2019
- Monday, January 7, 2019
- Tuesday, January 8, 2019
- Wednesday, January 9, 2019

Please join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/752299719> during office hours to get
some help!


## Allocation Year Turnover <a name="neway"/> ##

Several changes will take effect for the new allocation year (AY):
- There will be new software environment defaults;
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will become mandatory in the majority of
cases;
- Users will need to agree to a new Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) before accessing
NERSC resources.

More details about each of these will be provided in the next several weeks.

### New Software Environment Defaults

In accordance with NERSC's software update policy, we will set a new default
CDT (Cray Developer Toolkit) and remove the oldest versions from both Edison
and Cori.

### MFA Mandatory

The multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users will become mandatory in order
to access NERSC resources in the majority of cases.

### New Acceptable Use Policy

The terms of the AUP and the information we collect will undergo a small change
in AY 2019. Starting later this week, users will be permitted to begin agreeing
to these new terms. All users must agree to the new AUP before they can use
NERSC resources in AY 2019.


## Register Now for Edison to KNL Training this Wednesday! <a name="edison2knl"/> ##

NERSC will hold a half-day training event aimed at users who depend primarily
on Edison this Wednesday, December 12, 2018, from 9:00-11:30 am (Pacific). The
aim is to provide users who have not yet moved their workflows from Edison to
the KNL nodes on Cori with the knowledge to do so. The training session will
begin with an overview of the differences between Edison and the Cori KNL 
nodes, followed by an overview of compiling and running jobs, and ending with
some time for questions and hands-on work with NERSC staff.

The training will also be beneficial to users who are interested in 
transitioning from the Haswell nodes to the KNL nodes. We recommend that users 
who rely primarily on the Haswell nodes determine whether this transition is
possible for even a small fraction of their workflow, because the 
already-crowded queues for Haswell nodes are likely to become even more 
congested after Edison is decommissioned.

It's not too late to sign up to attend virtually via Zoom technology. For
more information and to register to attend, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/edison-to-knl-user-training-december-12-2018/>.


## 2019 ERCAP Allocations Announced <a name="ercap"/> ##

DOE program managers have completed the majority of their decisions, and NERSC 
has been sending out award announcements. There are a few awards that have not
been decided yet but we expect them to be complete by COB tomorrow. Thanks for
your patience as we finish the process.


## NESAP Call for Proposals Closes December 18! <a name="nesap"/> ##

Are you interested in partnering with NERSC to prepare your simulation,
data-intensive, and/or machine-learning application workloads for the
upcoming Perlmutter HPC system? If so, consider applying for the NESAP for
Perlmutter program. The call is open to applications with all levels of
accelerator readiness.

Accepted teams will be partnered with resources at NERSC, Cray, and NVIDIA,
including access to:
- NERSC application readiness staff assistance with code profiling and
optimization;
- Collaboration with and assistance from NVIDIA and Cray engineers;
- Training sessions and hackathons;
- Early access to Perlmutter;
- Opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to be placed within your
application team.

Selected teams will be responsible for
- Providing a benchmark problem and figure of merit on Edison (and Cori);
- Designating a point of contact for their code team and committing at least
0.5 FTE of effort per year on NESAP and related activities;
- Production of intermediate and final reports detailing science results and
performance improvement.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Computing resource usage within DOE Office of Science;
- Representation within the six programs in the Office of Science;
- Potential for scientific advancements;
- Potential for transfer of improvements to broader community;
- Resources available to augment NERSC/vendor resources;
- Committment from team (FTEs, etc.).

For more information and to apply, please see:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/announcements/featured-announcements/nesap-for-perlmutter/>.
Applications close next Tuesday, December 18, 2018!


## PASC19 Call for Submissions <a name="pasc"/> ##

The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) invites paper,
minisymposium, and poster submissions for PASC19, to be held June 12-14, 2019.

PASC19 is an international platform for the exchange of competences in 
scientific computing and computational science, with a strong focus on methods, 
tools, algorithms, application challenges, and novel techniques and usage of 
high performance computing. The technical program is centered around eight
scientific domains, including chemistry/materials, climate/weather, computer
science/applied math, life sciences, physics, solid earth dynamics, engineering,
and emerging application domains.

Submission deadlines are approaching:
- Papers: November 15, 2018 and January 15, 2019 (rolling deadline)
- Posters: January 13, 2019

For more information on submitting to PASC19, please see
<https://pasc19.pasc-conference.org/submission/submission-portal/>.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments Tomorrow <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, December 11, we will perform the final quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 1% of its allocation, it will be 
deleted and the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve. 

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.
