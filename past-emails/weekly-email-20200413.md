## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Shelter-in-Place Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in California, which is under a 
statewide Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order for an indefinite period of time.
Under this Order, only essential businesses may remain open. NERSC is considered
an essential business due to its national importance, so we remain in operation,
but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. All trainings will be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.


### Join Us for the Inaugural NERSC Users Group Special Interest Group on Experimental Facilities Meeting Next Wednesday! <a name="nugsig"/></a> 

The NERSC Users Group (NUG) has formed a new Special Interest Group (SIG) on
Experimental Facilities. The purpose of the SIG is to provide a forum for users
who process data from experimental facilities to discuss policies and tools
that are of specific interest to these users and to advise NERSC on how to
improve its support of these workflows.

The first meeting of the SIG will be next Wednesday, April 22 at 10 am 
(Pacific). The agenda will be:
1. A presentation on best practices and tips for users from experimental
facilities running at NERSC
2. Organizational discussion

To join the meeting, please see <https://www.jlab.org/indico/event/383/>.


### Share Your Research, Images, Movies, and Journal Covers with NERSC! <a name="share"/></a> 

NERSC is always looking for stories, images, movies, and journal cover stories 
related to research conducted at NERSC. Please tell us about your research using
the [NERSC Science Highlights Submission Form](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlight-submit/) 
and we could feature your work in our [news stories](https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/science-news/), 
[science highlight presentations](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlights-presentations/), 
and/or other NERSC presentations and reports.


### Join the NERSC Users Slack Sponsored by NUG Today! <a name="slack"/></a> 

Are you interested in discussing NERSC happenings and issues with your fellow
NERSC users? Do you want to get or give some advice from a user perspective 
about something in your workflow? If so, please join the NERSC Users Slack
workspace. For more information and a link to join, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/nersc-users-slack/> (login required).

**Please note that this Slack workspace is not an official NERSC staff-supported
platform.** While NERSC staff may sometimes join the NERSC Users Slack, the
best way to reach NERSC is still through the online help desk at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


### New Cray Hyperparameter Optimization Tool for Machine Learning Now Available <a name="crayhpo"/></a> 

Are you interested in using NERSC resources for machine learning model selection
and hyperparameter tuning? Cray has made their new Cray-HPO library for 
hyperparameter optimization available to our users. Cray-HPO integrates easily 
with Cori and provides popular optimization algorithms like random search, grid 
search, genetic search, and population based training, with more features being 
added for future releases. 

To get started with using the tools, please see our documentation page:
<https://docs.nersc.gov/analytics/machinelearning/hpo/>.
See also the presentation on hyperparameter optimization and Cray-HPO from our 
[SC19 Deep Learning at Scale tutorial](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KJm08Ry4qJXOl19MAu2Ao1t_fRNaMwZn?usp=sharing).

Please submit a help desk ticket if you have any issues or questions.


### New NERSC Cray Programming Environment/CDT Policy <a name="pecdtpolicy"/></a> 

NERSC has updated its Cray Programming Environment/Cray Developer Toolkit
(PE/CDT) policy. We have decided to change default software versions once per 
year, at the start of the allocation year only. Exceptions to the policy include
major operating system upgrades and critical security flaws or software bugs.

Read the policy at <https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/CDT-policy/>.


### April Cori Maintenance Planned to Begin Evening of April 21 <a name="aprmaint"/></a> 

The April monthly maintenance includes a Cori scratch file system check that was
rescheduled from March. The file system check is a lengthy process so instead of
starting the maintenance on Wednesday morning as usual, we will begin at 10:00 
pm (Pacific time) on Tuesday, April 21. At that time, Cori and the Cori scratch 
system will become unavailable to users. We expect that the maintenance will be 
complete and all systems returned to users by 11:59 pm on April 22.


### April Software Additions on Cori <a name="aprcdt"/></a> 

The Intel compiler versions 19.0.8.324 and 19.1.0.166 are now available on Cori.
During the April maintenance, we will add Cray Developer Toolkit (CDT) version
20.03 to Cori. There will be **no software default version changes at this 
time.** For a list of the new software versions available, please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2020Apr/>.


### Help Us Improve Your Jupyter Experience (Survey) <a name="jupytersurvey"/></a> 

Researchers from the Data Science and Technology Department at Lawrence Berkeley
National Lab (Berkeley Lab) are conducting a survey of scientific researchers 
working with simulation and data analysis software at HPC facilities as part of 
the Usable Data Abstractions (UDA) project. This survey will help us better 
understand how such work is conducted using Project Jupyter tools (Notebooks, 
Lab, Hub, etc.) supported at facilities like NERSC. The results will be used to
inform the development and deployment of next-generation workflow tools and data
abstractions to make them more intuitive to use and better match the way 
scientists understand and think about their data, and to identify opportunities 
to improve the NERSC Jupyter experience. **If your research work uses Project 
Jupyter tools on HPC systems then we are seeking your participation in our
study**.

Participating in this study involves spending only 5-10 minutes completing our 
online survey at the following link: <https://forms.gle/G4mS5KG158pQgVno8>.

Please follow the link above if you are interested in participating in this 
research. If you know someone else who might be interested in participating, 
then please feel free to forward this message to that person.

If you have any further questions about taking part in this study, please 
contact Dr. Lavanya Ramakrishnan at 510-486-4384. Any questions you have about 
your rights as a potential research subject can be answered by the Berkeley Lab 
Human Subjects Committee at 510-486-6005.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts April 23 <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
[Thursday April 23](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/spin/)
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action at the 
[Spin documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/spin/) page.


### CUDA Training Series Continues Next Thursday, April 16 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **This event will be held 
exclusively online.**

The fourth training in the series, on Fundamental CUDA Optimization, is a
continuation of what was learned last time about optimization strategies related
to kernel launch configurations, GPU latency hiding, global memory throughput, 
and shared memory applicability.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.

Registration for part 4 closes this Thursday, April 9. For more 
information (including registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/fundamental-cuda-optimization-part-2-part-4-of-9-cuda-training-series/>.

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- May 13: [5. CUDA Atomics, Reductions, and Warp Shuffle](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-atomics-reductions-and-warp-shuffle-part-5-of-9-cuda-training-series/)
- June 18: 6. Managed Memory
- July 21: 7. CUDA Concurrency


### OpenACC Training Series at NERSC and OLCF, starting April 17 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

**NVIDIA will present a [3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)**
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **The April training will be online only.**

More details are available on the series web pages:
- [Introduction to OpenACC (April 17)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-openacc-part-1-of-3-openacc-training-series-april-17-2020/)
- [OpenACC Data Management (May 28)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/openacc-data-management-part-2-of-3-openacc-training-series-may-28-2020/)

## NERSC News  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Missed the February 28 GPU Training? Videos Now Available! <a name="gputrainvids"/></a> 

Did you miss the "Intro to GPU" training on February 28? Do you want to brush up
on what you may have forgotten about GPUs? Recordings of the training sessions
are now available on the NERSC YouTube channel in a
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYUJN8AxZaY&list=PL20S5EeApOStGe26O8BxMAG4n_gKJVHRT).


### No Quarterly Allocation Reductions in 2020 <a name="noquartlyreduction"/></a> 

We know that users don't like long queue waits or having unused time 
automatically removed from their allocation balances. So NERSC is **eliminating 
quarterly allocation reductions for 2020.** 

Historically, NERSC automatically removed time from projects that were using 
their allocation slowly and the time was redistributed to others, contributing 
to a glut of allocation and long queue waits later in the year. While reductions
will not happen automatically, we remind you that the DOE Allocation Manager who
made your award has the ability to reallocate resources among projects during 
the year to meet DOE priorities.
