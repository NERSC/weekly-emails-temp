## Join Us for ERCAP Office Hours, this Friday and Next Monday! <a name="ercapofficehrs"/> ##

Allocations staff will hold virtual office hours via Zoom from 8:00 am to 5:00
pm (Pacific time) this Friday, October 12, and next Monday, October 15, to 
assist users finishing up their ERCAP requests.

Sharing video will make it easier for allocations staff to help troubleshoot 
user issues. Join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/my/ercap.office.hours> during
office hours to get some help!


## Quarterly Maintenance Tomorrow on DTN and Globus Endpoints <a name="quartmaint"/> ##

The NERSC quarterly maintenance tomorrow will be rather limited in scope: only
the Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) and Globus endpoints will be under maintenance.
During the four-hour window from 8:00 to noon (Pacific time), these services
will be unavailable.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments Tomorrow <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, October 9, we will perform the third quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 10% of its allocation, then
90% of the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve. A repo
that has charged less than 20% of its allocation will have 75% of its allocation
returned to its DOE office reserve, and a repo that has charged less than 40% of
its allocation will have 25% of its allocation returned to its DOE office
reserve.

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## NERSC Public Events and Outages Google Calendars Available! <a name="calendar"/> ##

NERSC has two publicly viewable calendars aimed at users, the NERSC Public 
Events Calendar and the NERSC Outages Calendar, to help users keep track of 
what's going on at NERSC.

The **NERSC Public Events** calendar shows events such as trainings, NUG 
webinars, and this week's ERCAP office hours. It is viewable as a standalone 
calendar at
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGJsLmdvdl9sczBnZHRnaTdiOTNqcmVkbGVzMGlibDB1NEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t>, and you can also add it to your own
calendar:
- The Google Calendar ID is
<lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>

The **NERSC Outages** calendar is automatically populated by the NERSC Message 
of the Day (MOTD), and also includes historical information about when systems 
were unavailable or in degraded mode in addition to future scheduled outages. 
You can see it in MyNERSC at <https://my.nersc.gov/outagecal-cs.php>, or as a
standalone calendar at 
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,
and you can also add it to your own calendar:

<lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>


## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Open-Source Software Best Practices Next Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The October webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Open Source Best Practices: From Continuous Integration to Static
Linters", and will take place next Wednesday, October 17, 2018, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

Daniel Smith and Ben Prichard from the NSF-funded Molecular Sciences Software 
Institute, presenting this webinar, will discuss the many cloud and local
services available for open-source software free of charge, including continuous
integration, code coverage, and static analysis. These services and ideas are
agnostic to software language or application and can be used by anyone 
interested in easing the burden of software maintenance. The presenters will 
show how a small time investment at the beginning can be traded for long-term 
benefits.  

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/ci2sl/>.


## Submit Your Science Using NERSC to the APS March Meeting's (pre)-Exascale Science Session <a name="aps"/> ##

NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF are co-sponsoring a focus topic session entitled
"Building the Bridge to Exascale: Applications and Opportunities for Materials,
Chemistry, and Biology" (DCOMP 16.01.02) at the 2019 Annual March Meeting of 
the American Physical Society. This is an opportunity to present your 
breakthrough accomplishments that were enabled through the use of pre-exascale 
computing systems.

This focus session will bring together researchers with experience in the 
effective utilization of high-performance data and compute infrastructure, 
including supercomputers, communication networks, and data resources to achieve 
breakthrough scientific results. This includes researchers at experimental 
facilities such as light and neutron sources with extreme data-science 
requirements, including machine-learning approaches, and researchers in 
computational materials, computational chemistry and computational biophysics 
with experience in large scale simulations. Also of interest software 
development efforts which will enable novel science on pre-exascale and emerging
architectures.

The abstract submission deadline is Oct. 26, 2018. Abstracts can be submitted 
through the American Physics Society March Meeting website: 
<http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/index.cfm>


## Call for Papers for Special Issue in ACS Synthetic Biology <a name="iwbda"/> ##

Attendees of the 10th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA), 
held earlier this year in Berkeley, are invited to submit original work to the
"IWBDA 2018" Special Issue in ACS Synthetic Biology. For more information on
how to submit, please see <http://www.iwbdaconf.org/2018/acssynbio/index.html>.
Submissions are due December 31, 2018.


## 2019 ERCAP Call for Proposals Closes Next Monday, October 15! <a name="ercap"/> ##

The 2019 ERCAP Proposal season is now open! NERSC has updated and improved the 
ERCAP request form based on extensive user feedback. 

All current projects (including exploratory, education, and Director's Reserve 
projects) must be renewed for 2019 if you wish to continue using NERSC in the
new allocation year. New project requests may be submitted as well (to start in
2019).

For consideration of your request before the new allocation year begins, please 
apply at <https://ercap.nersc.gov> before 11:59 PM Pacific Time October 15. 

If you need some help with the ERCAP system, please submit a ticket via 
<https://help.nersc.gov>, call Accounts and Allocations at 1-800-66-NERSC,
Option 2, or attend [ERCAP Office Hours](#ercapofficehrs).


## Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Accepted through October 16 <a name="bssw"/> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
