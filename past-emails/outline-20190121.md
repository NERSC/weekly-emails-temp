## Resending Email from Monday! <a name="resend"/> ##

Apologies for sending the email scheduled for Monday on Friday instead. There
was a glitch that meant this email was not sent at its scheduled time and date.
Thanks to an alert reader for their query that helped us realize our mistake.
We promise that the email for next week will be sent on the proper date!
