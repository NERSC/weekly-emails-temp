## NUG Monthly Webinar Scheduled for Thursday, November 1 at 11 am <a name="nugwebinar"/> ##

The monthly NERSC Users Group (NUG) webinar has been scheduled for this 
Thursday, November 1, at 11 am. Topics on the agenda include an update on 
NERSC-9 and the latest developments for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) at 
NERSC.

For more information, including connection info, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-nov-1-2018/>.


## New User Training, Tuesday November 6 <a name="newusertrain"/> ##

NERSC will hold a training aimed at new users on Tuesday, November 6. 2018. The
goal is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on our computational
systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, tools, and best
practices; and data ecosystem.

The training will be presented online using Zoom technology and in person at
LBL's Shyh Wang Hall (Building 59, CRT) in Room 4102.

Please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/new-user-training-november-6-2018/>
for the agenda and to register. Registration for in-person attendance closes on
Friday!


## Method for Accessing Collaboration Accounts Updated <a name="collabsu"/> ##

NERSC has deployed an updated method for accessing collaboration accounts. 
Collaboration accounts, accounts connected to a repo that can be shared among 
its members to facilitate data and software management as well as production 
jobs, were accessed via gsissh in the past. 

Now, on Cori and Edison, the command to become a collaboration account has been 
simplified. Just typing "collabsu <collab_account_name>" and entering your NERSC
password is all you need to do. Access to these collaboration accounts is still 
controlled by the PI or PI Proxy. Collabsu is not yet deployed on the DTN nodes,
but will be soon. Please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/accounts/collaboration_accounts/> 
for more details.


## Please Take the Machine Learning at NERSC Survey! <a name="mlsurvey"/> ##

The role of Machine Learning (ML) in data analytics continues to grow. If you 
are currently using ML in your research or plan to in the future, we would like 
to make sure that our systems meet all of your workload needs.

Please take 5 minutes to fill out our survey about your development environment,
software stack, data, and algorithmic needs for your ML work. This feedback will
help us better support your needs.

Please take the survey here: <https://goo.gl/GLg5xz>


## NERSC Public Events and Outages Google Calendars Available! <a name="calendar"/> ##

NERSC has two publicly viewable calendars aimed at users, the NERSC Public 
Events Calendar and the NERSC Outages Calendar, to help users keep track of 
what's going on at NERSC.

The **NERSC Public Events** calendar shows events such as trainings, NUG 
webinars, and this week's ERCAP office hours. It is viewable as a standalone 
calendar at
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGJsLmdvdl9sczBnZHRnaTdiOTNqcmVkbGVzMGlibDB1NEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t>, and you can also add it to your own
calendar:
- The Google Calendar ID is
<lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>

The **NERSC Outages** calendar is automatically populated by the NERSC Message 
of the Day (MOTD), and also includes historical information about when systems 
were unavailable or in degraded mode in addition to future scheduled outages. 
You can see it in MyNERSC at <https://my.nersc.gov/outagecal-cs.php>, or as a
standalone calendar at 
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,
and you can also add it to your own calendar:

## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Large-Scale Jobs at NERSC <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, Berkeley Lab Computational Research 
Division staff scientist and prolific NERSC user David Trebotich, discusses
what all those big jobs of his are for, what makes running at full-machine 
scale challenging, and gives some tips on how to run at scale at NERSC.

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Large-Scale-Jobs-at-NERSC--David-Trebotich-Interview-e2gc6c>.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
