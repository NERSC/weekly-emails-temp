## This week's deadlines  <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC User Survey for AY 2019 Extended until Wednesday March 4 <a name="usersurvey"/></a> 

Users who were active in 2019 were sent personalized invitations for the 
annual NERSC User Survey from a company called NBRI. Thank you to the 650
users who have already submitted your feedback.

**The survey will remain open for another 2 days, until Wednesday March 4th**. 
Filling out the survey helps NERSC judge the quality of our services and 
identify areas we could improve, and is important for our annual reporting to 
DOE. If you haven't already, **please use the link in your email to complete
the survey before Wednesday**. 


### Call for Applications: Deep Learning for Science School due this Wednesday <a name="dl4sci"/></a> 

Are you interested in applying deep learning to your science problem? Would you
like to learn more about the capabilities of deep learning and how to use it in
high-performance computing environments, and connect with other scientists
working on similar problems?

NERSC, in collaboration with the Computing Sciences area at Berkeley Lab, is
hosting the second Deep Learning for Science School July 20-24, 2020. The school
will bring together researchers and engineers for lectures and tutorials on
state-of-the-art deep learning methods and best practices for running deep
learning on high-performance computing systems, and provide opportunities to
connect with fellow scientists with a shared interest in how the latest advances
in learning algorithms can be used for their science.

For more information, including how to apply, please visit
https://dl4sci-school.lbl.gov. Applications close on **March 4th**. 


### Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing Applications Due Today! <a name="atpesc"/></a>

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### User Dotfile Changes <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

Until now, NERSC reserved the standard dotfiles (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`,
`~/.cshrc`, `~/.login`, etc.) and users added customizations instead to the
corresponding `.ext` files (eg `~/.bashrc.ext`). During today's maintenance we 
have changed this setup so that dotfiles on NERSC systems are more like those 
on a traditional Linux system. 

You will now see that your dotfiles are no longer a symlink to NERSC-defined 
dotfiles and instead are a template that sources your `.ext` file, eg your
`~/.bashrc` file now looks like:

```
    # begin .bashrc
    if [[ -z "$SHIFTER_RUNTIME" ]]
    then
        . $HOME/.bashrc.ext
    fi
    # end .bashrc
```

We recommend that you move the contents of your `~/.bashrc.ext` into your
`~/.bashrc` file. For detailed help, please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/>.
Please let us know of any problems you encounter, by filing a ticket at 
<https://help.nersc.gov>.

## Upcoming training events  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop starts in April <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
[Thursday April 23](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/#toc-anchor-3) 
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.


### Data Analytics in Python on GPUs with NVIDIA RAPIDS, April 14, 2020 <a name="rapids"/></a> 

NERSC and NVIDIA are pleased to announce an all-day training event at NERSC on
**Tuesday, April 14, 2020** to teach NERSC users about the NVIDIA RAPIDS software
ecosystem for GPU-accelerated data analytics and machine learning.

The RAPIDS data science framework includes a collection of libraries for
executing end-to-end data science pipelines completely in the GPU, and is
designed to have a familiar look and feel to data scientists working in Python.
We expect RAPIDS to become an essential way for Python users to do data
analytics on Perlmutter's GPUs.  Join us and learn directly from the developers
how to transition your Python-based data analytics workflows to GPUs.

As part of the training, attendees will be given access to the Cori GPU testbed
to try exercises and try porting their own codes.  Access to the GPUs will
continue to be available to participants for a few days after the event for
further testing.

- Read more about the upcoming event [at this link](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/rapids-hackathon/).
- Sign up for the event [using this form](https://forms.gle/dek7fJLrn3Y4UEnB8).
- Remote attendance will be supported via Zoom (details TBD) 

We look forward to seeing you.


### CUDA Training Series Continues March 18 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture (for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote 
participants). OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each 
part of the series.

The third training in the series, on Fundamental CUDA Optimization, will 
introduce users to optimization strategies related to kernel launch configurations, 
GPU latency hiding, global memory throughput, and shared memory applicability.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where in-person 
participants can complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented 
concepts.

Registration for part 3 **closes on March 11**. For more information 
(including registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/fundamental-cuda-optimization-part-1-part-3-of-9-cuda-training-series/>

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- April 16: [4. Fundamental CUDA Optimization (Part 2)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/fundamental-cuda-optimization-part-2-part-4-of-9-cuda-training-series/)
- May 13: [5. CUDA Atomics, Reductions, and Warp Shuffle](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-atomics-reductions-and-warp-shuffle-part-5-of-9-cuda-training-series/)


### OpenACC Training Sereies at NERSC and OLCF, starting April 17 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

**NVIDIA will present a [3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)**
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote participants). 
OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each part of the series.

Please see details at:
https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-openacc-part-1-of-3-openacc-training-series-april-17-2020/
