## 2019 ERCAP Call for Proposals Now Open <a name="ercap"/> ##

The 2019 ERCAP Proposal season is now open! NERSC has updated and improved the 
ERCAP request form based on extensive user feedback. 

All current projects (including startup, education, and Director's Reserve 
projects) must be renewed for 2019 if you wish to continue using NERSC in the
new allocation year. New project requests may be submitted as well (to start in
2019).

For consideration of your request before the new allocation year begins, please 
apply at <https://ercap.nersc.gov> before 11:59 PM Pacific Time October 15. 


## DTN Network Upgrade Improves User Experience <a name="dtnupdate"/> ##

NERSC has upgraded all data-transfer node (DTN) public-facing interfaces from 
10G to 100G switches.  Users should no longer experience TCP retransmit errors 
when transferring large amounts of data into NERSC DTNs.


## Applications Open for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program <a name="bssw"/> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a
workshop or tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software
community.

For more information and to apply, please see <https://bssw.io/fellowship>.
There will be an informational webinar on September 21; please see the website
for connection details. Applications are due October 16. 


## Multi-Factor Authentication Required for Allocation Year 2019 <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In a recent email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that 
NERSC will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems
in the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Many users have experience with a variety of different MFA methods, for example 
when logging into their bank or favorite shopping website, or accessing their 
email. In some cases, access to a phone capable of receiving texts is required.
**The NERSC MFA implementation does not require these types of services to be
available, nor does it require an internet connection to generate a one-time
password.**

The simplest MFA method for most users will be to use Google Authenticator via 
their smartphone or tablet. For users without a device, alternatives are
available, including Authy for desktop and using a Yubikey token. Please stay 
tuned for more information on MFA, as we roll out even more services in the 
upcoming weeks.


## FICUS Call for Proposals (JGI/NERSC/KBase Joint Call) <a name="ficus"/> ##

The 2019 FICUS JGI-NERSC-KBase Biological Data Science call for proposals is 
open. Users will be given access to resources and capabilities through two DOE
Office of Science User Facilities -- the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and NERSC 
-- as well as the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase). The call aims to
help users perform large-scale computational analyses of genomics and related
omics data to solve problems relevant to the DOE missions in bioenergy and the
environment.

For more information and to apply, please see
<https://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/ficus-jgi-nersc/>. 
Proposals are due this Thursday, September 13, 2018.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Machine Learning at Scale <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, NERSC Application Performance Specialist
Thorsten Kurth discusses some interesting applications of machine learning to 
science, why some of the most interesting applications require computing at 
scale, and hear Thorsten's recommendations for how someone with a science 
background can get started in the field.

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Machine-Learning-at-Scale--Thorsten-Kurth-Interview-e269em>.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.
