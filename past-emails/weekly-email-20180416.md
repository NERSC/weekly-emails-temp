## ISC Travel Grants for Young Researchers Now Open <a name="isctravel"/> ##

Are you at least 21 years of age, enrolled in a university degree program or
working at a research facility, and interested in acquiring knowledge in data
science or computational science or interested in using HPC skills to solve
problems in a compute-intensive or data-intensive discipline by attending the
ISC High Peformance conference in June in Frankfurt, Germany?

If so, consider applying for a travel grant to attend the conference. The
evaluation criteria include the applicant's need and lack of funding
alternatives, the estimated cost of travel and accommodation, and how the
applicant plans to pay forward the knowledge they acquire at the conference.
For more information and to apply please see 
<https://www.isc-hpc.com/isc-travel-grant.html>. The application deadline is
May 1, 2018.


## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Software Citation on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The April webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Software Citation Today and Tomorrow", and will take place this
Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 10:00 am Pacific time.

Dan Katz, presenting this webinar, will discuss the state of software citation,
starting with the history of software citation, where the software community is
going, what the obstacles to progress are, and how they may be overcome.

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/software_citation/>.


## Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp, July 24-27 <a name="kokkos"/> ##

The OLCF will host a Kokkos training event organized by the Exascale Computing 
Project (ECP) on July 24-27, 2018. This training will cover the minimum required 
topics to get your application started on using Kokkos. For more information and 
to register please see <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/kokkosbc2/>


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Apply for SpinUp Training <a name="spin"/> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy web sites and science gateways, workflow managers,
databases and key-value stores, and all sorts of other network services that can
access NERSC systems and storage on the back end.

Spin is currently in a pilot phase and nearly ready for users. **Completion of the
SpinUp training program is required for access**, and applications are now open
for the first sessions to begin in mid-May. **Because SpinUp is hands-on and
interactive, space will be limited**.

Participants in SpinUp will attend three hands-on sessions and complete
take-home lessons to learn about the Spin platform, create running
services, and learn maintenance and troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote
participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action and apply for training at 
[Spin at NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) 

Applications close next Monday, April 23.


## Debugging and Profiling with Allinea (ARM) Tools and Others, April 24, 2018 <a name="arm"/> ##

<http://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/allinea-tools/>

NERSC is hosting an in-depth training event on debugging and optimizing parallel
codes with ARM (previously Allinea) GUI tools by an ARM engineer. He will
provide lectures and hands-on demonstrations of how ARM tools, DDT, MAP and
Performance Reports, reduce development time, simplify debugging, and ease
application performance enhancement. He will demonstrate how to use two tools.

A NERSC consultant, will also teach how to use other useful debugging tools that
are available on Cori and Edison.

**If your code has a code bug and you want it to be analyzed with the expert's
help, please bring your code with you. If you want help with your code's
performance profiling results interpreted and get advice with optimizations,
please generate profiling results using 
[ARM MAP](http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/performance-and-debugging-tools/MAP/) 
beforehand and bring the results to the class.**

For both remote and in person attendance, please register here: <https://goo.gl/q9ihkn>.


## Submissions for ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowships in Computational and Data Science Close April 30 <a name="sighpc"/> ##

Are you a currently enrolled graduate student focusing on computational or data 
science (or will you be one no later than October 15)? Are you a woman or a 
member of a racial or ethnic group that is currently underrepresented in the 
computing field in the country where you are studying? If so, you may be 
eligible to apply for the ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowship in Computational 
and Data Science.

Each fellowship recipient will receive a stipend of US$15000 annually for up to 
5 years as long as they are progressing in their degree program. In the case of 
non-US universities, the stipend will be adjusted depending on World Bank 
national price level ratio for the country where the degree will be earned. In 
addition, new fellowship recipients will be supported to travel to the annual SC 
conference, where they will be honored at the awards session.

The submissions close on April 30th. For more information please see 
<http://www.sighpc.org/fellowships>.


## OpenMP Training: Beyond the Common Core May 4 <a name="omp"/> ##

Tim Mattson from Intel and Helen He from NERSC will present a full day of 
intermediate-level OpenMP training at NERSC on May 4. Tim Mattson is one of the
creators of OpenMP, and has given engaging tutorials on OpenMP across its two
decades of existence. Helen He is NERSC's representative on the OpenMP
committee and an expert on its syntax and functionality.

Programmers may spend their entire OpenMP programming careers safely inside the
common core. Well rounded OpenMP programmers, however, should be aware of what
lays just beyond the common core. These less common features of OpenMP were
included in the language for a good reason and only by understanding them at a
high level can you know when you might need them. In this **hands-on tutorial**, you
will gain experience working outside the common core. We won't cover every
single feature beyond the common core, but we will survey them with enough
breadth so following this tutorial, you will be able to pick up and work with
what you need.

For the best experience, we recommend attending in person if at all possible, to
get the most out of the hands-on portions of the training.
The tutorial is being held in Building 59, Room 3101 on the Berkeley Lab campus. 
For registration and Zoom connection details please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/beyond-openmp-common-core-may2018/>
