## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Shelter-in-Place Impacts <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under a
shelter-in-place order.
NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support but no 
telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 19 November, 11am PT <a name="webinar"/></a> 

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our October
meeting is **this Thursday, 19 November, at 11am** (Pacific time), at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.

- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.

- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.

- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic topic is "NERSC and NERSC
  Users at SC20". This week and last week NERSC staff and many users
  have participated in SC20, the largest annual Supercomputing conference.
  We'll run through some highlights, have an open discussion of what our
  users found interesting and build up a list of topics and talks of
  interest to the NERSC user community.

- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?

- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent month.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-meeting-nov-19>
for details.


### (NEW) Expect Invitation to 2020 NERSC User Survey this Week <a name="usersurvey"/></a> 

NERSC is kicking off its allocation year 2020 user survey this week. We are once
again retaining an external company, National Business Research Institute, to
perform the survey. Expect an announcement, followed by a personalized 
invitation to take the survey, this week.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Final Full-Facility Power Outage December 15-20 <a name="powerupgrade"/></a> 

The final power upgrade for the Perlmutter installation will take place
December 15-20. During most of this time, power will be cut to the building 
where NERSC is housed. **You can expect that for the duration of the outage, 
NERSC resources will not be available.**

More details of the plan will be provided in a standalone email to users and 
subsequent weekly email items.


### Update on cscratch1 Issues in September/October <a name="cscratchupdate"/></a> 
We are happy to announce that the root cause of the cscratch1 crash in late
September, that caused an extended outage on Cori, has been identified and a
fix has been successfully tested.

Two separate bugs were identified: one in Lustre that caused the crash
itself, and one in a Lustre utility that prevented a fast recovery from the
crash. HPE has provided fixes for both of these, which we have been been
testing on an isolated, secondary metadata server for over a week now.

It will take some weeks to robustly integrate the fixes into Lustre and test
and deploy the update across cscratch1. In the meantime the mitigations already
in place are still effective: when using Lustre file striping to improve
performance of large scale I/O, please limit the stripe count to 72 (the setting
provided by the `stripe_large` utility). For more about Lustre striping please
see <https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/io/lustre/>.


### New PE Installations for this Week's Maintenance <a name="novpe"/></a> 

During this week's Cori maintenance, NERSC will install some new software and 
remove some old software. **Software defaults will remain the same.**

We will install the 20.10 Cray Programming Environment (PE) Software release and
retire the 20.03 PE. In addition, we will also install the new 19.1.2.254 
version of the Intel compiler (which is the release version 2020 update 2).

For more information about specific software versions being added and removed,
please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2020Nov/>.


### Try Out the New NERSC Help Portal! <a name="helpportal"/></a> 

NERSC has launched a new help portal, featuring a redesigned "open ticket" form
and quick access to other types of requests. Available at 
<https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp>, the new portal also includes
- Search: view requests and tickets visible to you from the past year;
- Recent tickets: lists all your tickets from the last 3 months;
- Project tickets: lists open tickets shared with at least one of your NERSC 
projects;
- Watchlist: lists open tickets for which you are on the watchlist.

After a period of testing, this new interface will become the default for 
<https://help.nersc.gov> (but the "classic view" will continue to remain
available).


### Test out NERSC's New, Filesystem-Like HPSS Interface! <a name="hpss"/></a> 

We've deployed an experimental interface for HPSS called GHI, which offers a 
more familiar file system interface for HPSS. You can use GHI to archive entire 
directory trees or large files without having to worry about bundling files with
htar; the system automatically moves files to a special instance of the HPSS 
archive dedicated to GHI in the optimal tape-friendly configuration for you. 

Documentation for GHI is available at
<https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/filesystems/ghi/>

Learn more by viewing this video demo of the system:
<https://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/superfacility/#toc-anchor-3>

This is still an experimental system, so don't put in any unique data. If you 
are interested in trying it out, please [open a ticket](https://help.nersc.gov) 
and we'll give you access.
