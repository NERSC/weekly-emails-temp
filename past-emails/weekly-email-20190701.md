## Independence Day Holiday on Thursday; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="july4"/> ##

This Thursday, July 4, consulting and account support will be unavailable due to
the Berkeley Lab-observed Independence Day holiday. Regular consulting and 
account support will resume the following day. Operations staff are available 
for urgent queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all times.


## Sign up Today for ECP/NERSC CMake Training! <a name="cmaketrain"/> ##

NERSC has partnered with ECP and Kitware to offer an introductory, 1.5-day
CMake training class at NERSC on July 29-30, 2019. The training aims to make
CMake more accessible to users who want to get the most out of the build
system.

For more information and to register, please see <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/cmake-training/>.


## Register Today for Petascale Computing Institute, August 19-23, 2019 <a name="petascale"/> ##

NERSC is co-hosting the [2019 Petascale Computing 
Institute](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/petascale-computing-2019) 
training in collaboration with ALCF, NCSA, OLCF, Pittsburgh Supercomputing 
Center, SciNet at U Toronto, and TACC.

Content is targeted to individuals conducting research and scholarship in all
disciplines, including graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, faculty,
researchers, scholars, educators, and practitioners in academia, industry, and
government agencies. The institute will benefit primarily research teams
preparing to scale their codes to petascale-class resources, people working on
parallel codes, and those needing to scale up computational and/or data analysis
codes.

Participants can attend in person at one of the host sites across the United 
States, Canada, Costa Rica, or Brazil, or may tune in live on YouTube. NERSC is
one of the host sites; check for a site in your area when signing up to
participate.

For more information, please see the
[agenda](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/bw-petascale-computing-2019/agenda)
and [registration](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/bw-petascale-computing-2019/host-sites).


## Sitewide Power Outage and Cori Maintenance (OS Upgrade), July 26-30 <a name="powmaint"/> ##

### Power Outage Over the Weekend

To complete the power upgrades required for Perlmutter, the power entering Shyh
Wang Hall (where NERSC is housed) must be shut down while new equipment is
installed. The work is expected to take two days, over the last weekend in July.

We plan to shut down all NERSC resources beginning on Friday, July 26, in 
preparation for the weekend power work. Power will be restored on or before
Monday, July 29, at which point we will begin a maintenance on Cori.

### Cori Maintenance: Operating System Upgrade

The operating system (OS) on Cori will be upgraded from CLE6.0UP07 to 
CLE7.0UP00, which is a **major version upgrade** that includes upgrading the 
kernel from SLES12 to SLES15. Thus, **rebuilding your software is required.** 
NERSC is also preparing to rebuild the software we support so that the most 
important software for users is available after the OS upgrade.

Due to the change in the operating system, we have learned that all Cray 
software versions older than CDT/19.03 will no longer work.


## Updates to Software Defaults after July Cori Maintenance <a name="swupdate"/> ##

After the July 26-30 power outage and Cori maintenance, new default software
environments will be set, in line with NERSC's 
[software update policy](https://www.nersc.gov/users/software/software-policies/software-update-policies-on-programming-environment/).

Highlights of the changes include setting the Intel compiler default version to
19.0.3.199; using the Cray software environment versions in
[CDT/19.03](https://pubs.cray.com/content/00687254-DA/DA00687253) as the new
defaults for the Cray-provided libraries and tools; and setting 2M hugepages as
the default page size.

We have recently learned that because the underlying kernel for the new
operating system jumped from SLES12 to SLES15, none of the software versions
that are currently or have in the past been the default versions will work.
**Therefore we will be unable to provide any earlier versions, and all software
will need to be recompiled and relinked.**

A webpage detailing the additions, removals, and changes in software environment
is available at <https://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/cori/updates-and-status/programming-environment-change-on-cori-in-july-2019/>.


## Applications for SC19 Early Career Program Now Open! <a name="earlycareer"/> ##

Are you within the first five years at a permanent research position and
interested in learning more about funding, publishing, mentorship, and time
management? Consider applying for the SC19 Early Career Program, held in
conjunction with the SC19 conference in Denver, Colorado, on Monday, November
11, 2019. For more information and to apply, please see
<https://sc19.supercomputing.org/submit/early-career-applications/>.


## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM) <a name="pawatm"/> ##

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC19 in Denver, Colorado, in mid-November, 2019.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using high-level parallel programming languages 
and frameworks;
- Examples demonstrating performance, compiler optimization, error checking, and
reduced software complexity;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Novel algorithms enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due **July 31, 2019**. For more information and to submit, 
please see <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>.


## Changes to Charging for the "Flex" and "Low" QOS! <a name="flexqueue"/> ##

Effective June 10, the discounts on the "flex" and "low" queues have been 
reduced.
- Jobs in the flex queue will receive a 75% discount (a user running a job that 
would cost 1000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 250 
NERSC-hours).
- Jobs in the low queue will receive a 25% discount (a user running a job that
would cost 10,000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 7500
NERSC-hours).

For more information on using the flex queue, please see
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#flex> for information about the QOS, and
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/examples/#variable-time-jobs> about running
variable-time jobs.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments on Wednesday, July 10 <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Wednesday, July 10, we will perform the following quarterly allocation 
adjustments: 
- If charged usage is less than 20%, we will remove 25% of the unused balance.
- If charged usage is less than 5%, we will remove 50% of the unused balance.

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## Registration Now Open for Annual NUG Meeting Friday July 19 in Rockville, MD <a name="nug"/> ##

This year's annual NUG meeting will take place on Friday July 19, 2019, in 
Rockville, MD (immediately following the SciDAC meeting). 

The meeting will include updates from DOE program managers and NERSC director
Sudip Dosanjh, an introduction to NERSC's new banking and identity management
system, highlights from NERSC users, Q&A with NERSC staff, and more!

Registration is now open at <https://www.orau.gov/nug2019/default.htm>. There
is no cost to register. We look forward to seeing you there!
