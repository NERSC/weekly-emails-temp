## Labor Day Holiday Next Monday; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="laborday"/> ##

Next Monday, September 3, consulting and account support will be unavailable due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed Labor Day holiday. Regular consulting and account
support will resume the next day. Operations staff are available for urgent
queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all times.


## Multi-Factor Authentication Required for Allocation Year 2019 <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In a recent email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that 
NERSC will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems
in the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Many users have experience with a variety of different MFA methods, for example 
when logging into their bank or favorite shopping website, or accessing their 
email. In some cases, access to a phone capable of receiving texts is required.
**The NERSC MFA implementation does not require these types of services to be
available, nor does it require an internet connection to generate a one-time
password.**

The simplest MFA method for most users will be to use Google Authenticator via 
their smartphone or tablet. For users without a device, alternatives are
available. Please stay tuned for more information on MFA, as we roll out even
more services in the upcoming weeks.


## Machine Learning for Science Workshop at LBNL, September 4-6, 2018 <a name="ml4sci"/> ##

Please join us for the inagural workshop on machine learning for science 
(ML4Sci), which will be held September 4-6, 2018 at Berkeley Lab.
The workshop features the latest work on scientific ML applications at the lab,
in areas as broad as high-energy physics, cosmology, chemistry, biosciences,
materials engineering, climate, and high-performance computing.

The final day of the workshop is a joint session with [NERSC's Data 
Day](#dataday).

For more information and to register, please see 
<https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/ml4sci>. Registration closes *today*!


## Join Us for NERSC Data Day, September 6-7, 2018! <a name="dataday"/> ##

The third annual NERSC Data Day will be held September 6-7, 2018, in combination
with the [LBNL Machine Learning for Science Workshop](#ml4sci). 

The first day will feature an overview of the data analytics and 
machine-learning software stacks at NERSC, with a focus on Python, Jupyter, and
Deep Learning frameworks (Tensor Flow and PyTorch). It will include demos and
hands-on sessions that cover a variety of topics, from best practices for 
efficient utilization of Cori's unique architecture to scaling neural networks
training to multiple nodes.

The second day will cover best practices for data management and transfer at
NERSC in addition to the HPC container technology, Shifter, and our new
edge-services platform, Spin. Join in person or remotely -- it will be a lot
of fun, we promise!

For more information and to register, please see: 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/data-day/data-day-2018/>.


## FICUS Call for Proposals (JGI/NERSC/KBase Joint Call) <a name="ficus"/> ##

The 2019 FICUS JGI-NERSC-KBase Biological Data Science call for proposals is 
open. Users will be given access to resources and capabilities through two DOE
Office of Science User Facilities -- the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and NERSC 
-- as well as the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase). The call aims to
help users perform large-scale computational analyses of genomics and related
omics data to solve problems relevant to the DOE missions in bioenergy and the
environment.

For more information and to apply, please see
<https://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/ficus-jgi-nersc/>. 
Proposals are due September 13, 2018.


## PyHPC Workshop Call for Papers: Deadline Extended to August 31! <a name="pyhpc"/> ##

Have you developed an innovative application in Python that you (or others) run 
on Edison or Cori, but haven't yet found the right venue to talk about your HPC 
Python Application? If so, then PyHPC 2018 is the workshop for you! The 
overarching theme of the workshop is productivity vs. performance in HPC and 
scientific programming.

The workshop will be held November 12, 2018 in conjunction with SC18. For more 
information, including a longer description of the workshop and deadlines, 
please see 
<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/call-papers-8th-workshop-python-high-performance-pyhpc-schreiber>.
Submissions are due August 31, 2018.


## Parallel Data Storage & Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems Workshop Call for Submissions Now Open <a name="pdsw"/> ##

The Joint International Workshop on Parallel Data Storage and Data Intensive 
Scalable Computing Systems (PDSW-DISCS'18) is accepting submissions for short 
papers and work-in-progress abstracts related to addressing challenges in 
high-performance parallel I/O, data management, and experimental and 
observational data.  Special attention will be given to issues in which 
community collaboration can be crucial for problem identification, workload 
capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared 
tools.

The workshop will be held on November 12, 2018 in conjunction with SC18.  For 
more information on guidelines and relevant topic areas, see 
<http://www.pdsw.org/index.shtml>.  Short paper submissions are due September 2,
and work-in-progress abstracts are due November 1.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Burst Buffer <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, NERSC Computational Systems Group's Dave
Paul discusses what a burst buffer is, why you would want to use it, and how to 
use the burst buffer on Cori. 

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Burst-Buffer--Dave-Paul-Interview-e23g6h/a-a50205>.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Apply for SpinUp Training <a name="spinup"/> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Completion of the SpinUp instructional workshop is required for access. 
Applications are now open for sessions in early September. SpinUp is hands-on 
and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.
