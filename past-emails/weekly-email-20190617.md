## Apply Now for August 2019 ECP/NERSC OpenMP Hackathon <a name="hackathon"/> ##

Are you looking to improve your code performance on next-generation hardware? Do
you want to port your code to energy-efficient systems but feel that you need 
the help experienced professionals to help you get started? Apply to the August
2019 OpenMP Hackathon!

NERSC, in collaboration with the ECP SOLLVE and Training Projects, is hosting 
a 3.5-day OpenMP Hackathon at NERSC the week of August 27-30, 2019. Hackathons
pair coding teams with related computational experts to push HPC codes to the 
next level in an intensive and highly collaborative environment. Learn more 
about how hackathons work on a recent NERSC User News
[podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Community-GPU-Hackathon-Kevin-Gott-Interview-e3s408/a-adsmir).

This Hackathon will focus on porting, optimizing, and evolving applications for
energy-efficient processor architectures, especially Intel Xeon Phi (KNL). In
addition, NERSC welcomes application teams interested in using the OpenMP
offload model (no matter their current programming model).
ECP coding teams and teams who plan on running on Cori and Perlmutter are 
especially encouraged to apply, but all code teams serious about working on 
OpenMP for energy-efficient systems will be considered. Get more information and
apply by visiting 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/ecp-nersc-openmp-hackathon-aug2019/>.
Applications close next Friday, June 28.


## Sitewide Power Outage and Cori Maintenance, July 26-30 <a name="powmaint"/> ##

To complete the power upgrades required for Perlmutter, the power entering Shyh
Wang Hall (where NERSC is housed) must be shut down while new equipment is
installed. The work is expected to take two days, over the last weekend in July.

We plan to shut down all NERSC resources beginning on Friday, July 26, in 
preparation for the weekend power work. Power will be restored on or before
Monday, July 29, at which point we will begin a maintenance on Cori before
returning it to users, ideally before the end of the day on Tuesday, July 30.

More details will be forthcoming as the schedule is established. Thank you for
your patience and your understanding.


## New to NERSC? Need a Refresher? Register for Friday's New User Training <a name="newusers"/> ##

Registration is still open for remote attendance for the NERSC New User Training
that will be held this Friday, June 21, 2019. This is a great opportunity for 
new users and anyone looking for a refresher to learn about how to user NERSC.

The purpose of the training is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on 
our computational systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, 
tools, and best practices; and data ecosystem.

The training will be presented online using Zoom technology and in person at
LBL's Shyh Wang Hall (Building 59, CRT).

Please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/new-user-training-june-21-2019/>
for the agenda and to register. 


## NERSC MongoDB Services on mongodb01-04 Migrating to New Hardware on July 10 <a name="mongodb"/> ##

MongoDB services on mongodb01-04 will be moving to new hardware on July 10. 
Users with databases on these hosts should have received an email last week; if 
you did not please contact <wbhimji@lbl.gov> to be added to the contact list for
further updates and information. 


## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM) <a name="pawatm"/> ##

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC19 in Denver, Colorado, in mid-November, 2019.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using high-level parallel programming languages 
and frameworks;
- Examples demonstrating performance, compiler optimization, error checking, and
reduced software complexity;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Novel algorithms enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due **July 31, 2019**. For more information and to submit, 
please see <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>.


## Changes to Charging for the "Flex" and "Low" QOS! <a name="flexqueue"/> ##

Effective June 10, the discounts on the "flex" and "low" queues have been 
reduced.
- Jobs in the flex queue will receive a 75% discount (a user running a job that 
would cost 1000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 250 
NERSC-hours).
- Jobs in the low queue will receive a 25% discount (a user running a job that
would cost 10,000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 7500
NERSC-hours).

For more information on using the flex queue, please see
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#flex> for information about the QOS, and
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/examples/#variable-time-jobs> about running
variable-time jobs.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments on Wednesday, July 10 <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Wednesday, July 10, we will perform the following quarterly allocation 
adjustments: 
- If charged usage is less than 20%, we will remove 25% of the unused balance.
- If charged usage is less than 5%, we will remove 50% of the unused balance.

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## Register Now for GPUs for Science Day, July 2-3! <a name="gpus4sci"/> ##

The [GPUs for Science Day](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/gpus-for-science/)
event, to be held July 2-3, 2019, is directed towards people at all levels of 
GPU experience (even no experience!). Day 1 includes a series of invited talks 
on various GPU topics, and day 2 will include tutorials, lightning talks, and a 
GPU hands-on challenge (with prizes!). 

Registration for the second day has unfortunately reached full capacity, and
less than twenty spots remain for the first day. Register now at: 
<https://forms.gle/ccMiEU5uxLRtzHps9>. Hope to see you there!


## Call for Proposals: High-Impact Science at Scale on Cori <a name="scalescience"/> ##

NERSC is seeking proposals to conduct high-impact science campaigns using
NERSC's Cori supercomputer at scale. A successful proposal would require the use
of at least 2000 KNL nodes to solve a problem, with a preference for proposals
that exploit Cori's unique capabilities (e.g., using all or most of the 9688
KNL nodes or making heavy use of the burst buffer). Data-intensive projects
requiring large-scale analytics (statistics, machine learning, deep learning)
are encouraged to apply.

Previous awards were in the range of 10-100 million NERSC hours. The number of
awarded projects will be determined based on the number, quality, and diversity
of responses, as well as by the aggregate amount of time requested. **This call
will remain open on an ongoing basis and submissions will be evaluated every two
weeks.**

For more information and to apply, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/announcements/featured-announcements/high-impact-science-at-scale-3>.


## Registration Now Open for Annual NUG Meeting Friday July 19 in Rockville, MD <a name="nug"/> ##

This year's annual NUG meeting will take place on Friday July 19, 2019, in 
Rockville, MD (immediately following the SciDAC meeting). 

The meeting will include updates from DOE program managers and NERSC director
Sudip Dosanjh, an introduction to NERSC's new banking and identity management
system, highlights from NERSC users, Q&A with NERSC staff, and more!

Registration is now open at <https://www.orau.gov/nug2019/default.htm>. There
is no cost to register. We look forward to seeing you there!
