## Memorial Day Holiday Today; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="memday"/> ##

Today, May 28, consulting and account support will be unavailable due to
the Berkeley Lab-observed Memorial Day holiday. Regular consulting and account
support will resume tomorrow. Operations staff are available for urgent
queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all times.


## Edison Maintenance Wednesday-Thursday <a name="edisonmaint"/> ##

The 36-hour upgrade of the operating system on Edison has been scheduled for
this Wednesday and Thursday, May 30-31.

The maintenance will now begin at 7:00 am Pacific on Wednesday, May 30, and
conclude at or before 7:00 pm on Thursday, May 31. During this time, the
Edison login nodes, compute nodes, and scratch system will be unavailable to
users. While it is possible that we will be able to return the system to users
earlier, users should plan on a 36-hour outage.

For information about why these maintenances take so much longer than a 
comparable operation on your laptop computer, please listen to the interview 
with NERSC system administrator James Botts at 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/May-Quarterly-Maintenance--James-Botts-Interview-e1ec2g>


## Changes to NERSC Login Page on June 11 <a name="newloginpage"/> ##

The look of the web page that you use for logging into the NERSC help desk,
NERSC web site, and other web-based services at NERSC will be changing on June
11th. The new page features a streamlined design, provides a better experience
on mobile devices, and will help extend the use of Multi-Factor Authentication
and single sign-on to additional web services at NERSC.

We are announcing this change to minimize the suprise and suspicion that can
occur when there is a change in the page you use for entering your credentials.
Normally, if you were to see a change in the NERSC login page, we would ask you
to let us know either via a ticket, or a phone call to 1-800-66-NERSC, because
it could be the sign of a phishing site interposing between you and NERSC. But 
in this case, since we are letting you know that this is happening, if you
notice this change after June 11, there is no cause for alarm.

To see screenshots of the new page, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/nersc-center-news/2018/new-look-coming-to-nersc-login-page-on-june-11>.


## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Reproducible Pipelines, June 13 <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The June webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Popper: Creating Reproducible Computational and Data Science
Experimentation Pipelines", and will take place Wednesday, June 13, 2018, at 
10:00 am Pacific time.

Ivo Jiminez, presenting this webinar, will discuss a way to streamline
scientific analysis by creating and publishing workflows, data, and models that 
are easy to reproduce, by using Popper. Popper is a protocol and command
language interpreter (CLI) tool for implementing scientific exploration
pipelines following a DevOps approach of unifying software development and 
operation in order to handle complexity in large coadbases.

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/popper/>.


## Cray Programming Environment Workshop, June 14 <a name="craytraining"/> ##

NERSC is hosting a full-day workshop on the Cray programming environment and
performance tools on Thursday, June 14, 2018. It will begin with a 
presentation entitled "Applying 'Whack-a-mole' Method using Cray perftools to
identify the moles" in the morning, and continue with presentations on the
new features in the Cray programming environment, more tips and tricks on
using perftools, and conclude with an introduction to the Cray Programming
Environment Deep Learning Scalability Plugin.

For more information and to register, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cray-pe-workshop-june2018/>.


## Tell NERSC about Your Experience on Cori KNL! <a name="knlsurvey"/> ##

NERSC wants to know how you use the Cori KNL partition and how we can better
assist users in making the transition to KNL. Please take our survey at 
<https://goo.gl/forms/aoew0wlqY5xObB812> and give us your honest feedback! The
survey should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.


## Listen to the New "NERSC News" Weekly Podcast! <a name="podcast"/> ##

NERSC is always looking for new ways to communicate about upcoming events and 
share interesting information with users. We have launched a new weekly podcast,
entitled "NERSC News", which is available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> 
and syndicated through iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to 
this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Archive-Storage-System-and-Wayne-Hurlbert-Interview-e1hkmj/a-a3mila>

The topic of this week's podcast is the data archive, and features an interview 
with Wayne Hurlbert, a NERSC HPSS system administrator. In this podcast, learn
what the data archive is, how it works, and NERSC's plans to relocate the
archive in our machine room on the Berkeley Lab campus.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## Try Multi-Factor Authentication on NERSC Resources! <a name="mfa"/> ##

NERSC encourages you to try Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a new security
feature that can help prevent compromise of user accounts. With MFA, when you
log in you will enter your NIM plassword plus a One-Time-Password (OTP). At
this time, when using MFA at NERSC you will get the OTP via an app (Google
Authenticator) on your smartphone or tablet.

At this time, MFA is available for ssh access to Cori, Edison, Genepool,
Denovo, PDSF, and Data Transfer Nodes. We continue to work on enabling it for
additional services. 

For more information and to get started, please see the MFA web page on the
NERSC website: <https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa/>.


## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM) <a name="pawatm"/> ##

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC18 in Dallas, Texas in mid-November, 2018.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using parallel programming languages;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Algorithmic models enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due July 31, 2018. For more information and to submit, please
see <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>.


## Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp, July 24-27 <a name="kokkos"/> ##

The OLCF will host a Kokkos training event organized by the Exascale Computing 
Project (ECP) on July 24-27, 2018. This training will cover the minimum required
topics to get your application started on using Kokkos. For more information and
to register please see <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/kokkosbc2/>
