## Thanksgiving Holiday Thursday and Friday; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="holiday"/> ##

This Thursday and Friday, November 22 and 23, consulting and account support 
will be unavailable due to the Berkeley Lab-observed Thanksgiving holiday. 
Regular consulting and account support will resume on Monday, November 26. 
Operations staff are available for urgent queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, 
at all times.


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Registration Now Open for SpinUp Training <a name="spinup"/> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science
gateway projects!  Applications are now open for sessions that begin December 6.
SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.


## NESAP Call for Proposals Now Open! <a name="nesap"/> ##

Are you interested in partnering with NERSC to prepare your simulation,
data-intensive, and/or machine-learning application workloads for the
upcoming Perlmutter HPC system? If so, consider applying for the NESAP for
Perlmutter program. The call is open to applications with all levels of
accelerator readiness.

Accepted teams will be partnered with resources at NERSC, Cray, and NVIDIA,
including access to:
- NERSC application readiness staff assistance with code profiling and
optimization;
- Collaboration with and assistance from NVIDIA and Cray engineers;
- Training sessions and hackathons;
- Early access to Perlmutter;
- Opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to be placed within your
application team.

Selected teams will be responsible for
- Providing a benchmark problem and figure of merit on Edison (and Cori);
- Designating a point of contact for their code team and committing at least
0.5 FTE of effort per year on NESAP and related activities;
- Production of intermediate and final reports detailing science results and
performance improvement.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Computing resource usage within DOE Office of Science;
- Representation within the six programs in the Office of Science;
- Potential for scientific advancements;
- Potential for transfer of improvements to broader community;
- Resources available to augment NERSC/vendor resources;
- Committment from team (FTEs, etc.).

For more information and to apply, please see:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/announcements/featured-announcements/nesap-for-perlmutter/>.
Applications close on December 18, 2018!


## Now Enabled: MFA on Most NERSC Systems <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In an email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that NERSC 
will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems in 
the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Currently, MFA is enabled on the majority of systems at NERSC. Most recently, 
MFA was enabled on the NERSC myproxy server, which impacts users of NEWT, 
<https://my.nersc.gov>, and NERSC globus endpoints.

For more information about MFA at NERSC, there are many resources, including:
- [The NERSC MFA webpage](https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa), which is a trove of information about the MFA infrastructure at NERSC;
- [The NERSC User News podcast interview with Abe Singer](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Latest-MFA-Developments-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e288uq),
in which Abe discusses the sshproxy tool and answers common user questions about
MFA;
- The NUG Monthly Webinar: there is a [video](https://youtu.be/vLzihdTX4kg) of 
the [September 27 webinar](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-sept-27-2018/)
which included in-depth information about sshproxy and more, and slides from the
[November 1 webinar](http://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-nov-1-2018/), 
in which we covered using MFA at NERSC, are also available.

In addition, NERSC will be developing more MFA-related content and providing
opportunities for users to get some additional assistance in the upcoming weeks.

And of course NERSC consultants are always happy to take your questions via a
ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov>.

We encourage you to try out these features before MFA becomes mandatory in the
new allocation year.


## No New "NERSC User News" Podcast this Week <a name="nopodcast"/> ##

Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, there will be no new episode of the "NERSC 
User News" podcast this week.

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. 

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## NERSC HPSS Archive Systems Offline <a name="hpssoutage"/> ##

There are currently large wildfires burning in California; much of the
smoke from fires to the north is blowing into the Bay Area and the ocean wind
is currently blowing toward land, preventing the smoky air from dissipating over
the ocean. Unfortunately, this means that the air quality is particularly poor 
in Berkeley and Oakland, where NERSC has its facilities.

Particulate counts in the air at our Oakland site, where our HPSS systems are
housed, were so high on Friday that we could not operate the HPSS systems
safely, so we made the decision to shut the systems down until the situation
improves.

Unfortunately, air quality remains poor so the systems are still offline.
There is no timeline for NERSC to return the HPSS systems to users, but
weather forecasts predict rain on Wednesday, which should improve the air
quality. 

We are hopeful that we will be able to return the HPSS systems to users soon. In
the meantime, we appreciate your patience as we protect the integrity of the
tape library systems!
