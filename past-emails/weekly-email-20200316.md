## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Expected During Bay Area Shelter-in-Place Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in the six-county San Francisco
Bay area which is under a public health shelter-in-place Order for 14 days
beginning tomorrow. Under this Order, only essential businesses may remain open.
NERSC is considered an essential business due to its national importance, so we 
will stay in operation, but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely 
and only a skeleton crew onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. All trainings will be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing will be so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### One-Day Roofline on GPUs Demo Session, April 13 <a name="roofline"/></a> 

Are you interested in gaining a better understanding of your application's
performance on GPUs? Do you want to learn a methodology for improving 
application performance? If so, please join us at the Roofline on GPUs 
Demo Session, which will be held on April 13.

The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive and insightful way to
understand application performance, identify bottlenecks, and perform 
optimizations for HPC applications. 

Please note that due to the current situation, we have postponed the hackathon 
component of the event.

For more information and to register, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/roofline-on-nvidia-gpus-hackathon/>. Registration closes April 6.


### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts in April <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
[Thursday April 23](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/#toc-anchor-3) 
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.


### NVIDIA RAPIDS Training on April 14, 2020 is Now Online Only <a name="rapids"/></a> 

We will hold the NVIDIA RAPIDS training on April 14 exclusively online. If you 
planned to come to NERSC for this training, please tune in remotely.


### CUDA Training Series Continues March 18 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **The entire event will be 
online exclusively for this and the following event.**

The third training in the series, on Fundamental CUDA Optimization, will 
introduce users to optimization strategies related to kernel launch 
configurations, GPU latency hiding, global memory throughput, and shared memory 
applicability.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.

Registration for part 3 **closes this Wednesday, March 11**. For more 
information (including registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/fundamental-cuda-optimization-part-1-part-3-of-9-cuda-training-series/>

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- April 16: [4. Fundamental CUDA Optimization (Part 2)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/fundamental-cuda-optimization-part-2-part-4-of-9-cuda-training-series/)
- May 13: [5. CUDA Atomics, Reductions, and Warp Shuffle](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-atomics-reductions-and-warp-shuffle-part-5-of-9-cuda-training-series/)


### OpenACC Training Sereies at NERSC and OLCF, starting April 17 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

**NVIDIA will present a [3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)**
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **The April training will be online only.**

More details are available at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-openacc-part-1-of-3-openacc-training-series-april-17-2020/>

## NERSC News  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Cori Maintenance on Wednesday, March 25 <a name="corimaint"/></a> 

The March Cori system maintenance will begin just after midnight (Pacific time)
on Wednesday, March 25. During this maintenance, we will be upgrading the Cori
scratch software stack to a newer version. 

There will be a reservation in place to prevent jobs from running into the 
maintenance time. Any users on the system will be logged off and there will be 
no user access to the system for the duration of the outage, which is expected 
to end at 5 pm.

Note that during the maintenance, the Cori scratch file system will be
unavailable everywhere, including on the Data Transfer Nodes and through Globus.


### NERSC Software Support Policy <a name="swpolicy"/></a> 

Supporting the wide range of scientific software needed by a community 
as large and diverse and NERSC users is a challenging task. In AY2020
NERSC is working on the implementation of a new 
[Software Support Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/),
with the intent to allow us to focus software support efforts where they will 
have the most impact. You can read more about the new policy at 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/>.
