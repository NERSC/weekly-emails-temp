## Voting for NUGEX Now Open! <a name="nugex"/> ##

Voting is now open for the NERSC User Group (NUG) executive committee. There are
eight openings on the committee. Please vote at <https://goo.gl/y1TmTc> (NERSC
username and password required).


## New User Training this Wednesday at NERSC <a name="training"/> ##

Attention new NERSC users: It's not too late to sign up to remotely attend the 
New User Training on Wednesday!

We will hold a one-day training event for new users this Wednesday, March 21, 
to provide users new to NERSC with the basics for using NERSC systems. Topics 
include accounts and allocations, programming environment, tools, best practices
and the data-intensive science ecosystem. 

The event will be held at LBL's Shyh Wang Hall (Building 59, CRT) in Room 4102. 
All sessions will presented online using Zoom but we highly recommend attending 
in-person if you can.

See <https://goo.gl/6nLbUi> for details and registration.


## Scheduling NERSC Outages <a name="schedout"/> ##

At NERSC, we try to minimize the disruptions to our users' science. If it were
possible, we would leave all systems running at all times. Unfortunately, nodes
crash, hardware fails, and software requires updates.

So we do our best to minimize the amount of time we need to take machines 
offline. We do not schedule maintenance just for the sake of taking maintenance.

In previous years NERSC has sometimes delayed maintenance for the short-term 
gain of keeping users running. This has at times then snowballed into bigger 
problems that resulted in even more serious issues -- and emergency maintenances 
with longer downtimes! -- at a later date.  While we don't need to take the 
machines down every week, we do need to take a maintenance every so often.

We also received feedback from the user survey that our outage schedule was
unpredictable and did not permit users to plan around it. This was a valid
criticism, so to address these issues, we have instituted a monthly maintenance
schedule beginning in April.

During months that have no quarterly maintenance, we will schedule maintenance
for Cori and Edison on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month, 
respectively. While we may not need this maintenance every time, users can
plan for an outage and be pleasantly surprised when the machine is available,
rather than being inconvenienced by an unexpected outage.

Thanks for your patience as we deliver better reliability for you!


## Cori Maintenance Scheduled for Thursday <a name="corimaint"/> ##

The Cori system will undergo a software upgrade this Thursday, March 22. The
maintenance will begin at 7:00 am Pacific time. Cori login nodes and Cori 
scratch will be available to users. No jobs will run for the duration of the 
maintenance, but user jobs in the queue will be retained. The system will
be returned to users by 4:00 pm Pacific time. 

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/live-status/> for live system status
during the maintenance.


## Edison Maintenance Scheduled for Wednesday <a name="edmaint"/> ##

The Edison system will undergo a software upgrade this Wednesday, March 21. The
maintenance will begin at 7:00 am Pacific time. Edison will be inaccesible and 
no jobs will run for the duration of the maintenance, but user jobs in the queue
will be retained. The maintenance is scheduled to last up to 36 hours, until 
Thursday, March 22 at 7:00 pm Pacific time, although we hope to return the 
machine to users before that time.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/live-status/> for live system status
during the maintenance.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments on April 10 <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, April 10, we will perform the first quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 10% of its allocation, then
25% of the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve.

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## Frequent Reservations on Cori KNL Anticipated <a name="gbell"/> ##

We anticipate that there will be more reservations than usual on the Cori KNL
nodes for the next 6-8 weeks. We appreciate your patience during this time if
your jobs do not have the same throughput due to these reservations.


## Students: Spend a Summer at NERSC! <a name="summerstudents"/> ##

Are you an undergraduate or graduate student looking for a summer internship in
high-performance computing? If so, please consider applying for the NERSC/Berkeley
Lab Computing Sciences summer student program. We have exciting internships
available for profiling and simulating HPC networks, understanding performance
variability on HPC networks, evaluating the use of OpenMP on accelerators, and
more! Please apply today at
