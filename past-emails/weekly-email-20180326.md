## Voting for NUGEX Now Open! <a name="nugex"/> ##

Voting is now open for the NERSC User Group (NUG) executive committee. There are
eight openings on the committee. Please vote at <https://goo.gl/y1TmTc> (NERSC
username and password required).


## Applications for Science Gateways Bootcamp Close March 30 <a name="scigatebc"/> ##

Do you want to learn gateway building, from start to finish? If so, consider 
applying for the Incubator-organized Science Gateways Bootcamp, a week-long, 
intensive workshop for leaders of gateways who want to further develop and 
scale their work. Participants will engage in hands-on activities to help them
articulate the value of their work to key stakeholders and to create a strong
development, operations, and sustainability plan. Workshop participants work
closely together and will have the opportunity to network and establish
relationships with others engaging in similar activities.

Participation in the workshop is free, and most meals will be provided.
Attendees will need to pay for travel, hotel, and remaining meals.

The upcoming bootcamp will be held May 14-18 at the Texas Advanced Computing
Center in Austin, Texas. Bootcamps are offered twice a year, so if you can't 
make this one, there will be another session in the late (Northern-hemisphere)
summer.

For more information and to apply, please see 
<https://sciencegateways.org/engage/bootcamp>.


## Submissions for ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowships in Computational and Data Science Close April 30 <a name="sighpc"/> ##

Are you a currently enrolled graduate student focusing on computational or data 
science (or will you be one no later than October 15)? Are you a woman or a 
member of a racial or ethnic group that is currently underrepresented in the 
computing field in the country where you are studying? If so, you may be 
eligible to apply for the ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowship in Computational 
and Data Science.

Each fellowship recipient will receive a stipend of US$15000 annually for up to 
5 years as long as they are progressing in their degree program. In the case of 
non-US universities, the stipend will be adjusted depending on World Bank 
national price level ratio for the country where the degree will be earned. In 
addition, new fellowship recipients will be supported to travel to the annual SC 
conference, where they will be honored at the awards session.

The submissions close on April 30th. For more information please see 
<http://www.sighpc.org/fellowships>.



## Scheduling NERSC Outages <a name="schedout"/> ##

At NERSC, we try to minimize the disruptions to our users' science. If it were
possible, we would leave all systems running at all times. Unfortunately, nodes
crash, hardware fails, and software requires updates.

So we do our best to minimize the amount of time we need to take machines 
offline. We do not schedule maintenance just for the sake of taking maintenance.

In previous years NERSC has sometimes delayed maintenance for the short-term 
gain of keeping users running. This has at times then snowballed into bigger 
problems that resulted in even more serious issues -- and emergency maintenances 
with longer downtimes! -- at a later date.  While we don't need to take the 
machines down every week, we do need to take a maintenance every so often.

We also received feedback from the user survey that our outage schedule was
unpredictable and did not permit users to plan around it. This was a valid
criticism, so to address these issues, we have instituted a monthly maintenance
schedule beginning in April.

During months that have no quarterly maintenance, we will schedule maintenance
for Cori and Edison on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month, 
respectively. While we may not need this maintenance every time, users can
plan for an outage and be pleasantly surprised when the machine is available,
rather than being inconvenienced by an unexpected outage.

Thanks for your patience as we deliver better reliability for you!


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments on April 10 <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, April 10, we will perform the first quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 10% of its allocation, then
25% of the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve.

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## Frequent Reservations on Cori KNL Anticipated <a name="gbell"/> ##

We anticipate that there will be more reservations than usual on the Cori KNL
nodes for the next 6-8 weeks. We appreciate your patience during this time if
your jobs do not have the same throughput due to these reservations.


## Students: Spend a Summer at NERSC! <a name="summerstudents"/> ##

Are you an undergraduate or graduate student looking for a summer internship in
high-performance computing? If so, please consider applying for the NERSC/Berkeley
Lab Computing Sciences summer student program. We have exciting internships
available for profiling and simulating HPC networks, understanding performance
variability on HPC networks, evaluating the use of OpenMP on accelerators, and
more! Please apply today at
<https://lbl.referrals.selectminds.com/jobs/2018-nersc-summer-student-projects-cs-summer-student-program-565>.
