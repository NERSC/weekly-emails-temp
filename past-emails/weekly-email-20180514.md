## NUG Monthly Webinar this Thursday at 11 am <a name="nugwebinar"/> ##

The monthly NERSC Users Group (NUG) webinar will take place this Thursday,
May 17, at 11 am. Topics on the agenda include tips on getting better
throughput on Cori and Edison, and a new feature, variable-length jobs.

For more information, including connection info, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-may-17-2018/>


## Edison Maintenance Rescheduled for May 30-31 <a name="edisonmaint"/> ##

The 36-hour upgrade of the operating system on Edison has been rescheduled for
one week later than originally planned, due to scheduling conflicts at NERSC.

The maintenance will now begin at 7:00 am Pacific on Wednesday, May 30, and
conclude at or before 7:00 pm on Thursday, May 31. During this time, the
Edison login nodes, compute nodes, and scratch system will be unavailable to
users. While it is possible that we will be able to return the system to users
earlier, users should plan on a 36-hour outage.

For information about why these maintenances take so much longer than a 
comparable operation on your laptop computer, please listen to the interview 
with NERSC system administrator James Botts at 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/May-Quarterly-Maintenance--James-Botts-Interview-e1ec2g>


## Cray Programming Environment Workshop, June 14 <a name="craytraining"/> ##

NERSC is hosting a full-day workshop on the Cray programming environment and
performance tools on Thursday, June 14, 2018. It will begin with a 
presentation entitled "Applying 'Whack-a-mole' Method using Cray perftools to
identify the moles" in the morning, and continue with presentations on the
new features in the Cray programming environment, more tips and tricks on
using perftools, and conclude with an introduction to the Cray Programming
Environment Deep Learning Scalability Plugin.

For more information and to register, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cray-pe-workshop-june2018/>.


## Tell NERSC about Your Experience on Cori KNL! <a name="knlsurvey"/> ##

NERSC wants to know how you use the Cori KNL partition and how we can better
assist users in making the transition to KNL. Please take our survey at 
<https://goo.gl/forms/aoew0wlqY5xObB812> and give us your honest feedback! The
survey should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.


## Listen to the New "NERSC News" Weekly Podcast! <a name="podcast"/> ##

NERSC is always looking for new ways to communicate about upcoming events and 
share interesting information with users. We have launched a new weekly podcast,
entitled "NERSC News", which is available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> 
and syndicated through iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to 
this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/MFA--Abe-Singer-Interview-e1fied>

The topic of this week's podcast is multi-factor authentication (MFA) and 
features an interview with NERSC security analyst Abe Singer.  In this
episode, find out all about MFA at NERSC, as well as the name of the podcast 
theme song!

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## Try Multi-Factor Authentication on NERSC Resources! <a name="mfa"/> ##

NERSC encourages you to try Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a new security
feature that can help prevent compromise of user accounts. With MFA, when you
log in you will enter your NIM plassword plus a One-Time-Password (OTP). At
this time, when using MFA at NERSC you will get the OTP via an app (Google
Authenticator) on your smartphone or tablet.

At this time, MFA is available for ssh access to Cori, Edison, Genepool,
Denovo, PDSF, and Data Transfer Nodes. We continue to work on enabling it for
additional services. 

For more information and to get started, please see the MFA web page on the
NERSC website: <https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa/>.


## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM) <a name="pawatm"/> ##

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC18 in Dallas, Texas in mid-November, 2018.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using parallel programming languages;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Algorithmic models enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due July 31, 2018. For more information and to submit, please
see <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>.


## Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp, July 24-27 <a name="kokkos"/> ##

The OLCF will host a Kokkos training event organized by the Exascale Computing 
Project (ECP) on July 24-27, 2018. This training will cover the minimum required
topics to get your application started on using Kokkos. For more information and
to register please see <https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/kokkosbc2/>
