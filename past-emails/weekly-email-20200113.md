## New Allocation Year Begins Tomorrow <a name="neway"/></a> ##

The 2020 Allocation Year (AY) begins tomorrow. Several changes will take effect 
in the new AY. Of note:
- The [software environment defaults](#corisw) will change, as outlined in the 
[NERSC CDT Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/Cray-PE-CDT-policy/);
- The default linking mode changes to [dynamic](#dynamic) (from static);
- The default Python module will point to a version of Python 3;
- The new Community File System (CFS) will replace the Project File System;
- Charge factors will change from 90 for any node type to 140 for Haswell
nodes and 80 for KNL nodes;
- NERSC will have a new software policy, providing more clarity on how we
support software on Cori and future machines.

More details about the AY transition can be found at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/announcements/allocation-year-transition-2019-to-2020/>.


## Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Holiday Next Monday; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="mlkday"/></a> ##

Consulting and account support will be unavailable next Monday, January 20, due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. Regular 
consulting and account support services will resume the next day. Operations 
staff are available for urgent queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all 
times.


## Need Help Switching to Cori KNL Nodes? KNL Office Hours on Fridays All Month! <a name="knlofficehrs"/></a> ##

NERSC will hold virtual office hours over Zoom from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm Pacific 
Time for every Friday in January, including this Friday (January 17), to help 
users get their codes running efficiently on the Cori KNL nodes. 

For many users, running efficiently on the KNL nodes is as simple as making sure
that their job script is set to request the proper thread affinity on the node,
and their executable is compiled correctly to exploit the KNL architecture. We
have seen a performance gap shrink by a factor of 7 just with these two simple
steps.

Other user codes may require some relatively straightforward code changes (for
example, a loop reordering to exploit vectorization). Profiling the code is the
first step towards finding these hot spots or bottlenecks.

During the KNL Office Hours, NERSC experts will be on hand to help you take
these steps. Please (virtually) drop by for help with
- Setting up your job script for proper thread affinity
- Compiling your code with the best optimization flags
- Getting started with profiling your code
- Interpreting the results of profiling, and advice on how to proceed

A [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/KNL-Office-Hours-Jack-Deslippe-Interview-e3uk9f/a-aee631) 
from May provides additional information about the office hours.

## CUDA Training Series Begins Wednesday <a name="cudatrain"/></a> ##

NVIDIA will present a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture (for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote 
participants).  OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each 
part of the series.

The first training in the series will take place this Wednesday, January 15, 
2020, from 10 am to 12 pm (Pacific time). This training will introduce 
participants to CUDA C++, an extension of C++ that allows developers to program 
GPUs with a familiar programming language and simple APIs. Participants will 
learn basic concepts, syntax, and APIs needed to transfer data to and from GPUs,
write GPU kernels, and manage GPU thread groups. Following the presentation will
be a hands-on session where in-person participants can complete example 
exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.

For more information (including registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-cuda-c-part-1-of-9-cuda-training-series/>.

## New Community File System to Replace Project File System in New Allocation Year <a name="cfs"/></a> ##

The new "Community" File System (CFS) will replace the Project file system in
the new allocation year (AY). No action is required for users; NERSC will
transfer your data from Project to CFS.

Each active repository will have a directory on CFS with the path structure
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<repo_name>`, but existing 
`/global/project/projectdirs/<repo_name>` paths will redirect to the
corresponding CFS path until mid-2020.

During a one-week period **starting tomorrow**, the Project file system will be
set to read-only to allow a final synchronization between the two file systems.
Once this operation is complete, CFS will be made read/write and become
available for use, and Project will be removed from service. It is possible
that the synchronization may take less time than allotted, in which case we will
make CFS available earlier than scheduled.

For more details, please see
- The December 9 [email](https://www.nersc.gov/REST/announcements/message_text.php?id=4280)
announcing the new file system;
- Slides from the December 12 [NUG meeting](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-dec-12-2019/); or
- The December 9 NERSC User News [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Community-File-System-Kristy-Kallback-Rose--Greg-Butler--and-Ravi-Cheema-Interview-e9d88q/a-a149hf5) 
on the topic of CFS.


## Will Your Science Gateway Be Affected by the Community File System Sync? <a name="scigateway"/></a> ##

Developers of science gateways should be aware of the upcoming replacement of 
the NERSC Project File System (Project) with the new Community File System (CFS)
and the effect this may have on science gateways. Files on Project will be 
automatically transferred to CFS in a multiday sync, which is scheduled to begin
tomorrow. During that time, Project will be set to read-only. Any science 
gateways that need to write to Project will therefore be subject to breakage 
during that time. We recognize that this will be an inconvenience and that some 
gateway sites will temporarily lose functionality. Unfortunately, this is 
unavoidable. If your gateway's inability to write to Project during the sync 
will cause serious problems, please file a ServiceNow ticket with details about 
your gateway **immediately**, so that the science gateways team can help you 
find a workaround. 

Once the data transfer is complete, we will immediately update the web server so
that URLs like `https://portal.nersc.gov/project/myprojectdir` will again work 
as before but will then point to the new location on CFS. We will also enable a 
similar request-handling mechanism so that requests for URLs like 
`https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/myprojectdir` will retrieve files from directories
like `/global/cfs/cdirs/myprojectdir`. We recommend directing your traffic to 
the new `/cfs` URLs, since users will more readily recognize it as data on the 
community file system. 

If any of this needs further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out,
and we will work with you to ensure a smooth migration path. 


## New Programing Environments Defaults for New AY <a name="corisw"/></a> ##

The Cray Programming Environment Software release CDT/19.11 will become the 
default programming environment upon tomorrow's Allocation Year transition.
Included in this is a change to [dynamic linking](#dynamic) by default. 
The detailed list of new software is available at <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2019Dec-2020Jan>.

Cray compiler users shoule note the important information about the all-new CCE 
9.0 on the above webpage; in particular the CCE 9.0 C/C++ compiler is based on 
Clang instead of the classic Cray compiler. Key consequences of these changes 
include:
- CCE 9.0 compilers are not compatible with pre-CDT-19.06 library versions (such
as MPI);
- The OpenMP flag is no longer turned on by default.


## Dynamic Linking Is Default in New AY <a name="dynamic"/></a> ##

When the new CDT/19.11 is set as default at the time of the Allocation Year 
transition tomorrow, the default linking mode on Cori will change from static 
to dynamic. 

For best performance with dynamically linked executables running on the compute
nodes, we recommend storing your executable on 
`/global/common/software/<your_proj>` instead of the community file system. 
Note that /global/common is mounted as read-write on login nodes, and 
read-only on compute nodes.

If, after the default linking mode changes, you prefer to use static linking as 
default (e.g., for workflow or performance reasons), you can set:
```
% export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=static   
```
or add the `-static` flag in your compile and link lines to retain static 
linking.

If you need to use the previous default CDT/19.03 version (which has static 
linking as default), you can do so with:
```
% module load cdt/19.03 
% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
```
(this second line is needed only for dynamically linked executables.)


## User Dotfile Changes Planned for February 2020 <a name="dotfiles"/></a> ##

Currently, by default, `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`/`.cshrc`/`.login` files are 
symlinks in your `$HOME` to read-only NERSC-supplied startup files. You may have
made changes to your starting environment by adding 
`.bashrc.ext`/`.bash_profile.ext`/`.cshrc.ext`/`.login.ext` files.

To reduce some shell startup overhead, and to bring NERSC in line with most 
other HPC centers, we will migrate away from this arrangement during the 
scheduled maintenance in **February 2020**. After the change is made, you will 
be able to edit `.bashrc` (etc) directly.

During the change, your `.bashrc` (etc), which is currently a symlink, will be 
replaced by a template `.bashrc` (etc) that simply sources your `.bashrc.ext` 
(etc).

For most users this should have no other impact. But some non-default 
environments and workflows might experience some changes to their environment. 
You can test the changes now, by using the `dotmgr` command and logging in to 
cori12 or dtn12, which now have the new configuration:

    `dotmgr -l` # list my current dotfiles
    `dotmgr -s` # save my current dotfiles, and print the location
    `dotmgr -e` # replace my existing dotfiles with the new arrangement

You can then login to cori12 and/or dtn12 to check whether this affected your 
environment. Check that things still look the same and your aliases still work.

    `ssh cori12`

You can then return your dotfiles to the current configuration with:

    `dotmgr -r <directory-that-the-save-step-returned>`

Note that `dotmgr -e` and `dotmgr -r` **don't affect your current environment** 
-- they affect the contents of your dotfiles. For the changes to take effect, 
you must log out and log back in.

For detailed help, please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/>.
Please let us know of any problems you encounter, by filing a ticket at 
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC Forum (P3HPC) Submissions Close Next Friday <a name="p3hpc"/></a> ##

The call for papers for the Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC 
Forum (P3HPC) is now open. This workshop is an opportunity for
researchers to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for 
tackling the compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance, 
portability and productivity.
 
We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of 
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composability challenges 
arising from the use of bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" 
applications in the long term.

Submissions close next Friday, January 24, 2020. For more information and to submit a paper,
please see <https://p3hpcforum2020.alcf.anl.gov/>.


## NERSC Will Support Only Python3 Beginning Tomorrow <a name="python2"/></a> ##

Python 2 has reached its end of life ([January 1, 
2020](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches)),
so there will be no more development, bug fixes, patches, etc.

Therefore, starting tomorrow (the beginning of the 2020 Allocation Year at 
NERSC), the following changes to Python support will occur at NERSC:
- At the AY rollover, the default Python module will become a module based on a
Python 3 distribution.
- The old Python 2 module will remain available for use but users must specify
the version suffix.
- No new installations of Python 2 packages or modules will be performed.
- During the next Cori operating system upgrade, which could occur sometime in
2020, the Python 2 module will be retired.

NERSC will actively support only Python 3 (or future Python versions should
Python 3 become deprecated) on Perlmutter and future systems.

Please let us know your questions via a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov>.
