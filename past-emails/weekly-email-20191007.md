### Other Significant Dates ###

- **January 14, 2020**: First day of Allocation Year 2020
- **February 3, 2020**: ALCC Applications close


## Potential Impacts on NERSC from California Wildfire Season <a name="fireseason"/></a> ##

PG&E, which provides power to Berkeley Lab (and NERSC), is taking a more
conservative approach to wildfire prevention, which may result in power lines
being de-energized and the power to the NERSC machine room being cut with little
advance notice. While the chances are low that this will happen, NERSC has
plans for shutting down Cori smoothly (with enough advance warning) and
informing users. Users can also look at <http://status.lbl.gov/> to find out the
latest status of NERSC as well as Berkeley Lab as a whole.


## Last chance: ERCAP Virtual Office Hours TODAY <a name="ercapofficehrs"/></a> ##

Allocations staff are holding virtual office hours via Zoom from 8:00 am to 5:00
pm (Pacific time) to assist users finishing up their ERCAP requests, which
are due **today**, October 7.

Sharing video will make it easier for allocations staff to help troubleshoot 
user issues. Join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/my/ercap.office.hours> during
office hours to get some help!


## ERCAP Submissions Due TODAY, October 7! <a name="ercap"/></a> ##

Submissions for the 2020 ERCAP allocations process are **closing today**. NERSC 
is holding [ERCAP Office Hours](#ercapoffichrs) via Zoom to assist users with 
submitting their requests.

Please listen to this NERSC User News [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l)
for more information about ERCAP.


## MATLAB Maintenance for Toolbox Enhancements <a name="matlab"/></a> ##

On Wednesday, October 9, between 10 am and noon pacific time, MATLAB at
NERSC will undergo scheduled maintenance for installations. We are
making the symbolic math toolbox available and adding additional license
seats for the signal processing and statistics and machine learning
toolboxes. **Please be sure to log out of any MATLAB sessions**, including
those running in NX, in advance.


## Learn to optimize GPU code with Appentra Parallelware on October 17! <a name="parallelware"/></a> ##

Parallelware Trainer helps you to use OpenMP and OpenACC directives to develop 
code for CPUs and GPUs. On Thursday, October 17, Appentra founder Manuel Arneaz
will lead a training session at NERSC focused on optimization of GPU code, 
particularly addressing how to minimize data transfers, how to exploit massive 
parallelism and how to optimize the usage of the GPU memory. The workshop includes
a hands-on session where the participants will apply OpenMP and OpenACC offloading 
directives to their own code or a provided realistic example code.
 
Registration information and agenda for the day are available at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-tool-workshop-october-17>.
For more about the tool see [Parallelware Trainer](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/).
 

## Videos from June Appentra Parallelware Trainer Tool Training Now Available <a name="parallelwarevideos"/></a> ##

Did you miss the Appentra Parallelware Trainer tool training in June? Are you 
interested in brushing up on the basics about the tool before the training in
October?

The training presented on June 6 was recorded, and videos from the training are 
now available. To view the playlist on YouTube, please visit 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSvHYFsARV8bPUwwBm2xQh1A>.


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next Spinup Workshop Oct 30 <a name="spinup"/></a> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science
gateway projects!  **Applications for sessions that begin Wednesday, October 30
are now open**. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.


## Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Closing October 15 <a name="bssw"/></a> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a
workshop or tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software
community.

For more information and to apply, please see <https://bssw.io/fellowship>.
Applications are due Tuesday, October 15. 


## Sign up Now for UPC++ Workshop on November 1 at NERSC! <a name="upcpp"/></a> ##

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support 
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms 
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through 
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous 
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing 
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or 
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to 
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this tutorial we will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization 
techniques of UPC++. We will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and 
walk through implementing basic algorithms in UPC++. We will also look at 
irregular applications and how to take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize 
their performance.

This event can be attended on-site at NERSC or remotely via Zoom. The remote 
connection information will be provided to the registrants closer to the event. 
[Registration](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/upc/) is required for this 
event and space is limited so please register as soon as possible. Registration 
closes when the limit is reached or on October 18, 2019.


## New Requirement for ALCC Proposals <a name="alcc"/></a> ##

For the 2020-2021 ALCC campaign, PIs are **required** to submit a Letter of 
Intent (LOI) as the first step of submitting a proposal. The ALCC submission 
site (<https://science.osti.gov/ascr/ALCC>) opened October 1,
with LOIs due on December 16. 

All proposals are due when the submission site closes at 11:59 PM (Eastern Time)
on February 3, 2020. Information from the LOI will be automatically populated to
the proposal by December 18. Details about submission requirements can be found 
at <https://science.osti.gov/ascr/Facilities/Accessing-ASCR-Facilities/ALCC>.


## NERSC Will Support Only Python3 in New Allocation Year <a name="python2"/></a> ##

Python 2 will reach its end of life on [January 1, 2020](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches),
at which point there will be no more development, bug fixes, patches, etc.

Therefore, upon the beginning of the 2020 Allocation Year at NERSC, the 
following changes to Python support will occur at NERSC:
- At the AY rollover, the default Python module will become a module based on a
Python 3 distribution.
- The old Python 2 module will remain available for use but users must specify
the version suffix.
- No new installations of Python 2 packages or modules will be performed.
- During the next Cori operating system upgrade, which could occur sometime in
2020, the Python 2 module will be retired.

NERSC will actively support only Python 3 (or future Python versions should
Python 3 become deprecated) on Perlmutter and future systems.

Please let us know your questions via a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov>.
