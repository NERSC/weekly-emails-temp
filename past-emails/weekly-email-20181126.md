## Register Now for Edison to KNL Training on December 12 <a name="edison2knl"/> ##

NERSC will hold a half-day training event aimed at users who depend primarily
on Edison on Wednesday, December 12, 2018, from 9:00-11:30 am (Pacific). The
aim is to provide users who have not yet moved their workflows from Edison to
the KNL nodes on Cori with the knowledge to do so. The training session will
begin with an overview of the differences between Edison and the Cori KNL 
nodes, followed by an overview of compiling and running jobs, and ending with
some time for questions and hands-on work with NERSC staff.

Users can attend in person at Berkeley Lab or virtually via Zoom technology. For
more information and to register to attend, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/edison-to-knl-user-training-december-12-2018/>


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Registration Now Open for SpinUp Training <a name="spinup"/> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science
gateway projects!  Applications are now open for sessions that begin December 6.
SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.


## NESAP Call for Proposals Now Open! <a name="nesap"/> ##

Are you interested in partnering with NERSC to prepare your simulation,
data-intensive, and/or machine-learning application workloads for the
upcoming Perlmutter HPC system? If so, consider applying for the NESAP for
Perlmutter program. The call is open to applications with all levels of
accelerator readiness.

Accepted teams will be partnered with resources at NERSC, Cray, and NVIDIA,
including access to:
- NERSC application readiness staff assistance with code profiling and
optimization;
- Collaboration with and assistance from NVIDIA and Cray engineers;
- Training sessions and hackathons;
- Early access to Perlmutter;
- Opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to be placed within your
application team.

Selected teams will be responsible for
- Providing a benchmark problem and figure of merit on Edison (and Cori);
- Designating a point of contact for their code team and committing at least
0.5 FTE of effort per year on NESAP and related activities;
- Production of intermediate and final reports detailing science results and
performance improvement.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Computing resource usage within DOE Office of Science;
- Representation within the six programs in the Office of Science;
- Potential for scientific advancements;
- Potential for transfer of improvements to broader community;
- Resources available to augment NERSC/vendor resources;
- Committment from team (FTEs, etc.).

For more information and to apply, please see:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/announcements/featured-announcements/nesap-for-perlmutter/>.
Applications close on December 18, 2018!


## Now Enabled: MFA on Most NERSC Systems <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In an email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that NERSC 
will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems in 
the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Currently, MFA is enabled on the majority of systems at NERSC. Most recently, 
MFA was enabled on the NERSC myproxy server, which impacts users of NEWT, 
<https://my.nersc.gov>, and NERSC globus endpoints.

For more information about MFA at NERSC, there are many resources, including:
- [The NERSC MFA webpage](https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa), which is a trove of information about the MFA infrastructure at NERSC;
- Two recent NERSC User News podcast interviews with Abe Singer: 
    - [November 26, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Multi-Factor-Authentication-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e2kmad),
in which Abe discusses what will happen in the new allocation year when MFA
becomes mandatory and answers common user questions about using MFA, and
    - [September 17, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Latest-MFA-Developments-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e288uq),
in which Abe discusses the sshproxy tool and answers common user questions about
MFA;
- The NUG Monthly Webinar: there is a [video](https://youtu.be/vLzihdTX4kg) of 
the [September 27 webinar](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-sept-27-2018/)
which included in-depth information about sshproxy and more, and slides from the
[November 1 webinar](http://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-nov-1-2018/), 
in which we covered using MFA at NERSC, are also available.

In addition, NERSC will be developing more MFA-related content and providing
opportunities for users to get some additional assistance in the upcoming weeks.

And of course NERSC consultants are always happy to take your questions via a
ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov>.

We encourage you to try out these features before MFA becomes mandatory in the
new allocation year.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Multi-Factor Authentication <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, NERSC Security Specialist Abe Singer
returns to the show to talk about NERSC's plans for MFA and what will happen in
the new allocation year when MFA becomes mandatory, and answers frequently
asked user questions about MFA.

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Multi-Factor-Authentication-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e2kmad>.

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.
