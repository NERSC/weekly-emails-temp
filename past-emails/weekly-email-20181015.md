## Join Us for ERCAP Virtual Office Hours Today! <a name="ercapofficehrs"/> ##

Allocations staff are holding virtual office hours via Zoom from 8:00 am to 5:00
pm (Pacific time) today to assist users finishing up their ERCAP requests, which
are due **today**.

Sharing video will make it easier for allocations staff to help troubleshoot 
user issues. Join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/my/ercap.office.hours> during
office hours to get some help!


## 2019 ERCAP Call for Proposals Closes Today, October 15! <a name="ercap"/> ##

All current projects (including exploratory, education, and Director's Reserve 
projects) must be renewed for 2019 if you wish to continue using NERSC in the
new allocation year. New project requests may be submitted as well (to start in
2019).

For consideration of your request before the new allocation year begins, please 
apply at <https://ercap.nersc.gov> before 11:59 PM Pacific Time tonight!

If you need some help with the ERCAP system, please submit a ticket via 
<https://help.nersc.gov>, call Accounts and Allocations at 1-800-66-NERSC,
Option 2, or attend [ERCAP Office Hours](#ercapofficehrs).


## Cori Maintenance on Wednesday <a name="corimaint"/> ##

Cori will be down for maintenance this Wednesday, October 17. During this
maintenance, the login nodes and Cori scratch filesystem (cscratch1) will remain
available, but no jobs will run. During the maintenance, the batch system will 
be upgraded to version 18.08, the Datawarp patch will be installed, and a short 
test will be run on Cori scratch. During the test, a reservation will be put in 
place to prevent Edison jobs from using cscratch1.

The maintenance will commence at 7:00 am and we expect to return the machine to
users before 7:00 pm (Pacific).


## Please Take the Machine Learning at NERSC Survey! <a name="mlsurvey"/> ##

The role of Machine Learning (ML) in data analytics continues to grow. If you 
are currently using ML in your research or plan to in the future, we would like 
to make sure that our systems meet all of your workload needs.

Please take 5 minutes to fill out our survey about your development environment,
software stack, data, and algorithmic needs for your ML work. This feedback will
help us better support your needs.

Please take the survey here: <https://goo.gl/GLg5xz>


## NERSC Public Events and Outages Google Calendars Available! <a name="calendar"/> ##

NERSC has two publicly viewable calendars aimed at users, the NERSC Public 
Events Calendar and the NERSC Outages Calendar, to help users keep track of 
what's going on at NERSC.

The **NERSC Public Events** calendar shows events such as trainings, NUG 
webinars, and this week's ERCAP office hours. It is viewable as a standalone 
calendar at
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGJsLmdvdl9sczBnZHRnaTdiOTNqcmVkbGVzMGlibDB1NEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t>, and you can also add it to your own
calendar:
- The Google Calendar ID is
<lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>

The **NERSC Outages** calendar is automatically populated by the NERSC Message 
of the Day (MOTD), and also includes historical information about when systems 
were unavailable or in degraded mode in addition to future scheduled outages. 
You can see it in MyNERSC at <https://my.nersc.gov/outagecal-cs.php>, or as a
standalone calendar at 
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,
and you can also add it to your own calendar:

## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Open-Source Software Best Practices on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The October webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Open Source Best Practices: From Continuous Integration to Static
Linters", and will take place this Wednesday, October 17, 2018, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

Daniel Smith and Ben Prichard from the NSF-funded Molecular Sciences Software 
Institute, presenting this webinar, will discuss the many cloud and local
services available for open-source software free of charge, including continuous
integration, code coverage, and static analysis. These services and ideas are
agnostic to software language or application and can be used by anyone 
interested in easing the burden of software maintenance. The presenters will 
show how a small time investment at the beginning can be traded for long-term 
benefits.  

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/ci2sl/>.


## Submit Your Science Using NERSC to the APS March Meeting's (pre)-Exascale Science Session <a name="aps"/> ##

NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF are co-sponsoring a focus topic session entitled
"Building the Bridge to Exascale: Applications and Opportunities for Materials,
Chemistry, and Biology" (DCOMP 16.01.02) at the 2019 Annual March Meeting of 
the American Physical Society. This is an opportunity to present your 
breakthrough accomplishments that were enabled through the use of pre-exascale 
computing systems.

This focus session will bring together researchers with experience in the 
effective utilization of high-performance data and compute infrastructure, 
including supercomputers, communication networks, and data resources to achieve 
breakthrough scientific results. This includes researchers at experimental 
facilities such as light and neutron sources with extreme data-science 
requirements, including machine-learning approaches, and researchers in 
computational materials, computational chemistry and computational biophysics 
with experience in large scale simulations. Also of interest software 
development efforts which will enable novel science on pre-exascale and emerging
architectures.

The abstract submission deadline is Oct. 26, 2018. Abstracts can be submitted 
through the American Physics Society March Meeting website: 
<http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/index.cfm>


## Call for Papers for Special Issue in ACS Synthetic Biology <a name="iwbda"/> ##

Attendees of the 10th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA), 
held earlier this year in Berkeley, are invited to submit original work to the
"IWBDA 2018" Special Issue in ACS Synthetic Biology. For more information on
how to submit, please see <http://www.iwbdaconf.org/2018/acssynbio/index.html>.
Submissions are due December 31, 2018.


## Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Due Tomorrow! <a name="bssw"/> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a
workshop or tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software
community.

For more information and to apply, please see <https://bssw.io/fellowship>.
Applications are due *tomorrow*, October 16. 


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Superfacility <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, NERSC Deputy Director and Data
Department Head Katie Antypas talks about the Superfacility. Learn about what a 
superfacility is, how NERSC is helping users from experimental facilities to 
analyze their data, and what challenges lie ahead!

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is
