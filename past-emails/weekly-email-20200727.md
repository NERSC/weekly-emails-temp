## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Opens August 10! <a name="ercap"/></a> 

The ERCAP allocations process will begin accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY) on Monday, August 10. Requests will be accepted through
Monday, October 5, 2020.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen 
to [this podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l). 

Allocations staff will once again hold virtual office hours via Zoom to assist
users with finishing up and submitting their ERCAP requests, on the following
dates:
- Thursday, August 27
- Thursday, September 4
- Thursday, September 17
- Thursday, October 1
- Monday, October 5 (ERCAP due date)

We will provide more details, including times and connection info, as we get 
closer to the date.


### Videos from June New Users Training Now Available <a name="newuservideos"/></a> 

Did you miss the new users training last month? Are you interested in brushing
up on the basics about NERSC?

The training for new users presented on June 16 was recorded, and videos
from the training are now available. To view the playlist on YouTube, please
visit 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSsFDfNrshVdiaQKZK4CNFq7>.

## Calls for Participation <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Register Today for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting on August 17! <a name="nugmtg"/></a> 

Registration is open for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting, which is being
held online on Monday, August 17. 

An updated agenda for the meeting has been published **today**, and
includes time for short user talks. **If you are interested in speaking, please
include an abstract when you fill out your registration form.**

For more information and to register please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/annual-meetings/nug-2020/>.


### Submit a Paper to the Interactive HPC 2020 Workshop <a name="interactivehpc"/></a> 

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent 
HPC-based workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.
The real-time QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and
observational data workloads. Jupyter has become a major point of entry and 
platform for interactive ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd 
like to share with the world? Then please consider submitting a paper to the 
Fourth Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020. 
Position papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome
(up to 10 pages). The workshop itself will be held virtually on November 11, 12,
or 13, in conjunction with SuperComputing 2020.
For more details on the workshop, including submission instructions, please see:
<https://www.interactivehpc.com/>.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### CUDA Training Series Continues August 18 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The eighth training in the series, to be held on Tuesday, August 18, covers 
GPU performance analysis. This module introduces the analysis-driven 
optimization workflow using NVIDIA developer tools Nsight Systems and Nsight
Compute to profile your code and determine what optimizations to make.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/gpu-performance-analysis-part-8-of-9-cuda-training-series-august-18-2020/>.

The final scheduled event:
- September 17: [Cooperative Groups](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cooperative-groups-part-9-of-9-cuda-training-series-september-17-2020/)
