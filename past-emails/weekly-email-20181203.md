## Maintenance Impacting Jupyter on Thursday <a name="jupyter"/> ##

On Thursday, December 6, just before 2:00 pm (Pacific time), there will be a 
brief (less than 10 minutes duration) maintenance affecting the
[jupyter-dev](https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov) and 
[jupyter](https://jupyter.nersc.gov) services. The maintenance should
be very brief, but users will need to restart notebooks and kernels after the 
maintenance is over at 2 PM.


## Update on Maintenance Impacting MFA this Thursday <a name="mfaoutage"/> ##

A network maintenance will be performed for approximately 15 minutes on
Thursday, December 6, within the 6:00-6:30 pm (Pacific) window. Users should
experience no noticeable impact as the system are designed to continue
operating during maintenances like these.  Meanwhile, we will be monitoring for
any problems, and users should alert us immediately if they have any issues.

On Friday, NERSC sent a message indicating that could affect NERSC user MFA. As 
we learned more about the plans surrounding the maintenance, we no longer 
foresee a significant impact to users during the maintenance.


## PASC19 Call for Submissions <a name="pasc"/> ##

The Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) invites paper,
minisymposium, and poster submissions for PASC19, to be held June 12-14, 2019.

PASC19 is an international platform for the exchange of competences in 
scientific computing and computational science, with a strong focus on methods, 
tools, algorithms, application challenges, and novel techniques and usage of 
high performance computing. The technical program is centered around eight
scientific domains, including chemistry/materials, climate/weather, computer
science/applied math, life sciences, physics, solid earth dynamics, engineering,
and emerging application domains.

Submission deadlines are approaching:
- Minisymposia: December 7, 2018
- Papers: November 15, 2018 and January 15, 2019 (rolling deadline)
- Posters: January 13, 2019

For more information on submitting to PASC19, please see
<https://pasc19.pasc-conference.org/submission/submission-portal/>.


## Register Now for Edison to KNL Training on December 12 <a name="edison2knl"/> ##

NERSC will hold a half-day training event aimed at users who depend primarily
on Edison next Wednesday, December 12, 2018, from 9:00-11:30 am (Pacific). The
aim is to provide users who have not yet moved their workflows from Edison to
the KNL nodes on Cori with the knowledge to do so. The training session will
begin with an overview of the differences between Edison and the Cori KNL 
nodes, followed by an overview of compiling and running jobs, and ending with
some time for questions and hands-on work with NERSC staff.

The training will also be beneficial to users who are interested in 
transitioning from the Haswell nodes to the KNL nodes. We recommend that users 
who rely primarily on the Haswell nodes determine whether this transition is
possible for even a small fraction of their workflow, because the 
already-crowded queues for Haswell nodes are likely to become even more 
congested after Edison is decommissioned.

Users can attend in person at Berkeley Lab or virtually via Zoom technology. For
more information and to register to attend, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/edison-to-knl-user-training-december-12-2018/>.


## 2019 ERCAP Allocations Announced Next Monday <a name="ercap"/> ##

DOE program managers will complete their decisions this week, and NERSC will
begin sending out award announcements next Monday, December 10.


## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments Next Tuesday <a name="allocred"/> ##

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, December 11, we will perform the final quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 1% of its allocation, it will be 
deleted and the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve. 

For more information on allocation adjustments, please see 
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions/>.


## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Open-Source Software Best Practices on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The December webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Introduction to Software Licensing", and will take place this 
Wednesday, December 5, 2018, at 10:00 am Pacific time.

David Bernholdt from Oak Ridge National Laboratory will discuss how to decide
which software license to select based on what the developers whan others to be
able to do (or unable to do) with your software, and pragmatic issues around
actually applying a license to your software.

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/licensing/>.


## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Registration Open for SpinUp Training <a name="spinup"/> ##

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science
gateway projects!  Applications for sessions that begin December 6 *close 
today*, but you can also apply for future sessions. SpinUp is hands-on and 
interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the 
[NERSC Spin](https://www.nersc.gov/users/data-analytics/spin/) page.

## Now Enabled: MFA on Most NERSC Systems <a name="mfareq"/> ##

In an email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that NERSC 
will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems in 
the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Currently, MFA is enabled on the majority of systems at NERSC. Most recently, 
MFA was enabled on the NERSC myproxy server, which impacts users of NEWT, 
<https://my.nersc.gov>, and NERSC globus endpoints.

For more information about MFA at NERSC, there are many resources, including:
- [The NERSC MFA webpage](https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa), which is a trove of information about the MFA infrastructure at NERSC;
- Two recent NERSC User News podcast interviews with Abe Singer: 
    - [November 26, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Multi-Factor-Authentication-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e2kmad),
in which Abe discusses what will happen in the new allocation year when MFA
becomes mandatory and answers common user questions about using MFA, and
    - [September 17, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Latest-MFA-Developments-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e288uq),
in which Abe discusses the sshproxy tool and answers common user questions about
MFA;
- The NUG Monthly Webinar: there is a [video](https://youtu.be/vLzihdTX4kg) of 
the [September 27 webinar](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-sept-27-2018/)
which included in-depth information about sshproxy and more, and slides from the
[November 1 webinar](http://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-nov-1-2018/), 
in which we covered using MFA at NERSC, are also available.

In addition, NERSC will be developing more MFA-related content and providing
opportunities for users to get some additional assistance in the upcoming weeks.

And of course NERSC consultants are always happy to take your questions via a
ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov>.

We encourage you to try out these features before MFA becomes mandatory in the
new allocation year.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: NESAP Postdocs <a name="podcast"/> ##
