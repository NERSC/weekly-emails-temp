## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### NUG Meeting Slides and Livestream Available <a name="nugmtg"/></a> 

Today's NERSC User Group Annual Meeting was livestreamed today. If you missed
part of the meeting or wanted to take a look at some of it, you can peruse the 
slides or watch the recorded livestream.

This year's theme was Perlmutter, which is arriving at the very end of this 
year. Learn about the features and capabilities of the system, plus our plans 
for software and services, resources for getting your applications running on 
the GPUs, and how and when users will be able to access the machine. Breakout
sessions were held on topics such as AI and deep learning on Perlmutter, ERCAP
and Iris tricks and tips, application performance portability, and experimental
data best practices. User talks on their experiences and scientific results were
featured in a round of lightning talks.

For the slides, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/annual-meetings/nug-2020/>.
The [raw livestream video](https://youtu.be/Bj-BMomoZfo) is available on the 
NERSC YouTube channel.


### CUDA Training Series Continues Tomorrow, August 18 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The eighth training in the series, to be held tomorrow, August 18, covers 
GPU performance analysis. This module introduces the analysis-driven 
optimization workflow using NVIDIA developer tools Nsight Systems and Nsight
Compute to profile your code and determine what optimizations to make.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/gpu-performance-analysis-part-8-of-9-cuda-training-series-august-18-2020/>.

The final scheduled event:
- September 17: [Cooperative Groups](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cooperative-groups-part-9-of-9-cuda-training-series-september-17-2020/)


### Cori Monthly Maintenance on Wednesday <a name="corimaint"/></a> 

We will perform maintenance on Cori this Wednesday, August 19, beginning at 7:00
am (Pacific time). The maintenance will include monthly hardware repairs, a
minor patch installation, and the incorporation of new auxiliary nodes into the
system. We anticipate that the machine will be returned to users before the end
of the day.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Is Open! <a name="ercap"/></a> 

The ERCAP allocations process has now begun accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY). Requests will be accepted through Monday, October 5, 2020.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen 
to [this podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l). 

Allocations staff will once again hold virtual office hours via Zoom to assist
users with finishing up and submitting their ERCAP requests, on the following
dates:
- Thursday, August 27
- Thursday, September 4
- Thursday, September 17
- Thursday, October 1
- Monday, October 5 (ERCAP due date)

We will provide more details, including times and connection info, as we get 
closer to the date.


### Videos from GPUs for Science 2020 Now Available! <a name="gpu4scivids"/></a> 

Did you miss the GPUs for Science event that was held June 30 - July 1? Do you 
want to hear some of the talks again? Good news -- a 
[YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSt9K5orryFQ-55k9YZ2-Nna) 
featuring content from GPUs for Science is now available on the NERSC YouTube 
channel -- please take a look!

## Calls for Participation <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Submit a Paper to the Interactive HPC 2020 Workshop <a name="interactivehpc"/></a> 

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent 
HPC-based workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.
The real-time QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and
observational data workloads. Jupyter has become a major point of entry and 
platform for interactive ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd 
like to share with the world? Then please consider submitting a paper to the 
Fourth Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020. 
Position papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome
(up to 10 pages). The workshop itself will be held virtually on November 11, 12,
or 13, in conjunction with SuperComputing 2020.
For more details on the workshop, including submission instructions, please see:
<https://www.interactivehpc.com/>.
