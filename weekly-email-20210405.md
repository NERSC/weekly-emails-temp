## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Shelter-in-Place Impacts <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under 
public health order restrictions.
NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support but no 
telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

### NERSC Public Events and Outages Google Calendars Available! <a name="calendar"/></a> 

NERSC has two publicly viewable calendars aimed at users, the NERSC Public 
Events Calendar and the NERSC Outages Calendar, to help users keep track of 
what's going on at NERSC.

The **NERSC Public Events** calendar shows events such as trainings, and NUG 
webinars. It is viewable as a standalone calendar at
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGJsLmdvdl9sczBnZHRnaTdiOTNqcmVkbGVzMGlibDB1NEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t>, and you can also add it to your own
calendar:
- The Google Calendar ID is
<lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>

The **NERSC Outages** calendar is automatically populated by the NERSC Message 
of the Day (MOTD), and also includes historical information about when systems 
were unavailable or in degraded mode in addition to future scheduled outages. 
You can see it in MyNERSC at <https://my.nersc.gov/outagecal-cs.php>, or as a
standalone calendar at 
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,

### HPSS Archive Maintenance April 11-16; All Data in Archive Unavailable for Duration! <a name="hpssmaint"/></a> 

**Archive, the NERSC HPSS Tape Storage System, will be unavailable for a 
software upgrade from 7 am (Pacific) on April 11, 2021 to 7 pm on 
April 16, 2021.** Although Archive has been running stably without a system 
upgrade for nearly a decade, we must perform this upgrade to take advantage of 
more recent developments in HPSS software. Included in the process is an upgrade
of the metadata for the more than 245 million objects in the Archive, which we 
anticipate will take the bulk of the maintenance period.

**During this maintenance period users will not have any access to the Archive 
or its data, and will not be able to log into Archive** (e.g., via `hsi` or 
`htar` to archive data, via the NERSC HPSS Globus endpoint, or via ftp), so 
please plan accordingly. Once the upgrade is complete, you will be able to 
access your data as usual from any NERSC system without taking any further 
action.

After the maintenance is complete, users will once again have access to all
files on Archive as before. No user files will be deleted during the upgrade
process.

Thank you for your patience during this long-overdue upgrade process. Please 
open a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov> if you have any questions or if you 
need help finding temporary storage space while Archive is unavailable.


### "Compile" Queue Now Available on Cori! <a name="compileq"/></a> 

A new "Compile" queue is now available on Cori. The 
[compile queue](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#compile) 
is intended for workflows that regularly compile codes from source, e.g., 
DevOps models leveraging Continuous Integration. There is a single Haswell node 
allocated to jobs in this queue. There is no charge for using the compile queue,
but users must request access. If you are interested in accessing the compile 
queue, please fill out the Compile Queue 
[request form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9089a22f1b426010263aa82eac4bcb5b&sysparm_category=e15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f).


### Allocation Reductions Schedule Set for 2021 <a name="allocred"/></a> 

Allocation reductions will recommence this year after a one-year hiatus.
The reduction process takes unused allocation from projects not using them and
allows DOE program managers to redistribute that time to other projects. PIs and
PI proxies may request exemptions, at least one week before the reduction date.

Reduction dates this year will be **May 4 and September 7, 2021.** For more
information, including how much allocation will be removed, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions>.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### (NEW) IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Automated Fortran-C++ Bindings for Large-Scale Scientific Applications, May 12 <a name="ecpwebinar2"/></a> 

The May webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Automated Fortran-C++ Bindings for Large-Scale Scientific
Applications",
and will take place Wednesday, May 12, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Seth Johnson (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), 
will present a solution to the challenge of connecting existing Fortran code to
new internal C++ kernels or external C++ libraries, a challenge many developers
interested in performance portability models and other rapidly developing,
dynamic programming paradigms. SWIG-Fortran provides a flexible solution that
includes support for performant data transfers, MPI support, and direct
translation of C++ features to Fortran interfaces.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/fortran-cpp-bindings/).


### Sign Up for April 19 & 26 Timemory ECP Tutorial to Simplify Monitoring Your Application <a name="timemory"/></a> 

The Timemory toolkit is a suite of C/C++/Fortran/Python tools for performance
analysis, optimization studies, logging, and debugging, that can be used to
easily integrate and maintain the exact set of measurements/tools/features you
want to support with an interface best suited for your application. Timemory 
helps you simplify the monitoring of the state and performance of your
application so that relevant debugging, logging, and performance data can be 
trivially enabled or disabled in a consistent and portable manner.

The Timemory tutorial, to be held across two successive Mondays, April 19 & 26,
will introduce the user to Timemory, its command-line tools and APIs, and how
to use the individual components to build a custom tool.

The tutorial is sponsored by ECP, but open and available to all. Registration is
required. For more information and to register, please see 
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/timemory/>.


### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts April 15! <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. New large-memory nodes have been added to the platform, increasing the
potential of the platform for new memory-constrained applications.
To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin next month,
on [Thursday April 15](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/spin/)
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend an instructional session and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

If you can't make these upcoming sessions, never fear! We'll hold additional 
sessions in June, August, October, and December. 

See a video of Spin in action at the 
[Spin documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/spin/) page.
