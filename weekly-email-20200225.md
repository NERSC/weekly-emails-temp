## This week's deadlines  <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC User Survey for AY 2019 Closes this Friday, February 28th <a name="usersurvey"/></a> 

Users who were active in 2019 were sent personalized invitations for the 
annual NERSC User Survey from a company called NBRI. Thank you to the 500
users who have already submitted your feedback.

The survey helps NERSC judge the quality of our services and identify 
areas we could improve, and is important for our annual reporting to DOE.
If you haven't already, **please use the link in your email to complete
the survey before Friday, Feb 28th**. 


### Women in HPC Summit Student Program Applications Due this Friday, Feb 28! <a name="whpc"/></a> 

Applications are now open for the Women in HPC Summit Student Program. The
program is aimed at students of all levels interested in high-performance
computing. All students are required to submit a poster related to HPC topics
that they work on. These posters can be for new work or existing work.

Application materials include two documents:

- A student-prepared document containing a brief bio (including HPC background); a
statement about why you wish to attend the summit; your career aspirations; and
a 1-2 page extended abstract describing your poster contents.
- A letter of support from an academic advisor supporting your attendance.

For more information on the agenda for the student track please see the 
[WHPC Summit website](https://womeninhpc.org/events/summit-2020#!/submissions) 
(scroll down for "Student Program"); to submit please go to the
[submissions](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=whpcsummit2020) website. 

Applications close **this Friday!**


### Dummy article that should be removed <a name="dummy"/></a> 

this is to test automatically adding and pushing updates

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### User Dotfile Changes This Week <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

Until now, NERSC reserved the standard dotfiles (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`,
`~/.cshrc`, `~/.login`, etc.) and users added customizations instead to the
corresponding `.ext` files (eg `~/.bashrc.ext`). During today's maintenance we 
have changed this setup so that dotfiles on NERSC systems are more like those 
on a traditional Linux system. 

You will now see that your dotfiles are no longer a symlink to NERSC-defined 
dotfiles and instead are a template that sources your `.ext` file, eg your
`~/.bashrc` file now looks like:

```
    # begin .bashrc
    if [[ -z "$SHIFTER_RUNTIME" ]]
    then
        . $HOME/.bashrc.ext
    fi
    # end .bashrc
```

We recommend that you move the contents of your `~/.bashrc.ext` into your
`~/.bashrc` file. For detailed help, please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/>.
Please let us know of any problems you encounter, by filing a ticket at 
<https://help.nersc.gov>.

## NERSC news  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### NERSC Software Support Policy <a name="swpolicy"/></a> 

Supporting the wide range of scientific software needed by a community 
as large and diverse and NERSC users is a challenging task. In AY2020
NERSC is working n implementation of a new 
[Software Support Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/),
whose intent is to allow us to focus softwar esupport efforts where they will 
have the most impact. You can read more about the new policy at 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/>.


### Need Help? Check out NERSC Documentation or Send in a Ticket! <a name="gettinghelp"/></a> 

Are you confused about setting up your MFA token? Is there something not quite 
right with your job script that causes the job submission filter to reject it? 
Are you struggling to understand the performance of your code on the KNL nodes?

There are many ways that you can get help with issues at NERSC: 
- First, we recommend the NERSC documentation (<https://docs.nersc.gov/>).
Usually the answers for simpler issues, such as setting up your MFA token using
Google Authenticator, can be found there. (Often the answers to more
complex issues are in the documentation too!)
- For more complicated issues, or issues that leave you unable to work,
submitting a ticket is a good way to get help fast. NERSC's consulting team
will get back to you within four business-hours (8 am - 5 pm, Monday through
Friday, except holidays) with a response. To submit a ticket, log in to
<https://help.nersc.gov> (or, if the issue is stopping you from logging in, send
an email to <accounts@nersc.gov>).
- Sometimes, a colleague can figure out the issue faster than NERSC, because
they already understand your workflow. It's possible that they know what flag
you need to add to your Makefile for better performance, or how to set up your
job submission script just so. 


### New Community File System Now Available <a name="cfs"/></a> 

The new "Community" File System (CFS) has replaced the Project file system in
this allocation year (AY). 
Each active project has a directory on CFS with the path structure
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<repo_name>`, but existing 
`/global/project/projectdirs/<repo_name>` paths will redirect to the
corresponding CFS path until mid-2020.

**Please update the paths in your scripts** to use `/global/cfs/cdirs/` instead of 
`/project /projectdirs/` or `/global/project/projectdirs` at your earliest 
convenience!


### This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: The RAPIDS library <a name="podcast"/></a> 

In this interview with NVIDIA RAPIDS senior engineer Nick Becker, 
learn about the RAPIDS library, how it can accelerate your data 
science, and how to use it.

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-user-podcasts/> and 
syndicated through iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is
