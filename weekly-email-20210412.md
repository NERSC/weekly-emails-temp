## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Shelter-in-Place Impacts <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under 
public health order restrictions.
NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support but no 
telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 15 April, 11am PT <a name="webinar"/></a> 

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our April
meeting is **this Thursday, 15 April, at 11am** (Pacific time), at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic is tentatively a **showcase of
  SummitVR**, a DOE-supported effort to develop a collaborative VR data
  visualization platform. NERSC user Simon Woodruff will demonstrate the tool 
  and talk about how it can be used in DOE projects.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-meeting-apr-15-2021/>
for details.


### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts Thursday! <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. New large-memory nodes have been added to the platform, increasing the
potential of the platform for new memory-constrained applications.
To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
on [Thursday April 15](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/spin/)
are still open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend an instructional session and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

If you can't make these upcoming sessions, never fear! The next session begins
June 10, and we'll hold additional sessions in August, October, and December. 

See a video of Spin in action at the 
[Spin documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/services/spin/) page.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Creating a Script to Run Your Job? Use the NERSC Job Script Generator! <a name="jobscript"/></a> 

Do you need to create a script to run your job on Cori? Do you find it
challenging to get all the details right? If so, consider using NERSC's
[Job Script Generator](https://my.nersc.gov/script_generator.php)
to generate a batch script for you. The tool generates a bare-bones script that 
includes the correct process and thread-binding configurations, so you don't 
have to worry about the details.


### New VASP License Confirmation Process at NERSC <a name="vasp"/></a> 

All VASP license confirmation requests should now use the new
[VASP License Confirmation Request](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=d2935b561b032c106c44ebdbac4bcbb6&sysparm_category=e15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f) 
form located in the "Request Forms" section of the 
[NERSC Help Desk](https://help.nersc.gov).
For more information on the VASP license verification process, please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/vasp/#access>.


### HPSS Archive Maintenance April 11-16; All Data in Archive Unavailable for Duration! <a name="hpssmaint"/></a> 

Archive, the NERSC HPSS Tape Storage System, is currently unavailable for a 
software upgrade that started yesterday at 7 am (Pacific) and is expected to
last until 7 pm on April 16, 2021. 

Users have no access to Archive while it is under maintenance. This means users
cannot archive or retrive data until the upgrade is complete. Once the
maintenance is over, users will once again be able to access all files on
Archive as before. No user files will be deleted during the upgrade process.

Thank you for your patience during this long-overdue upgrade process. Please 
open a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov> if you have any questions or if you 
need help finding temporary storage space while Archive is unavailable.


### "Compile" Queue Now Available on Cori! <a name="compileq"/></a> 

A new "Compile" queue is now available on Cori. The 
[compile queue](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#compile) 
is intended for workflows that regularly compile codes from source, e.g., 
DevOps models leveraging Continuous Integration. There is a single Haswell node 
allocated to jobs in this queue. There is no charge for using the compile queue,
but users must request access. If you are interested in accessing the compile 
queue, please fill out the Compile Queue 
[request form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9089a22f1b426010263aa82eac4bcb5b&sysparm_category=e15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f).


### Allocation Reductions Schedule Set for 2021 <a name="allocred"/></a> 

Allocation reductions will recommence this year after a one-year hiatus.
The reduction process takes unused allocation from projects not using them and
allows DOE program managers to redistribute that time to other projects. PIs and
PI proxies may request exemptions, at least one week before the reduction date.

Reduction dates this year will be **May 4 and September 7, 2021.** For more
information, including how much allocation will be removed, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/allocation-reductions>.

will present a solution to the challenge of connecting existing Fortran code to
new internal C++ kernels or external C++ libraries, a challenge many developers
interested in performance portability models and other rapidly developing,
dynamic programming paradigms. SWIG-Fortran provides a flexible solution that
includes support for performant data transfers, MPI support, and direct
translation of C++ features to Fortran interfaces.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/fortran-cpp-bindings/).


### Sign Up for April 19 & 26 Timemory ECP Tutorial to Simplify Monitoring Your Application <a name="timemory"/></a> 

The Timemory toolkit is a suite of C/C++/Fortran/Python tools for performance
analysis, optimization studies, logging, and debugging, that can be used to
easily integrate and maintain the exact set of measurements/tools/features you
want to support with an interface best suited for your application. Timemory 
helps you simplify the monitoring of the state and performance of your
application so that relevant debugging, logging, and performance data can be 
trivially enabled or disabled in a consistent and portable manner.

The Timemory tutorial, to be held across two successive Mondays, April 19 & 26,
will introduce the user to Timemory, its command-line tools and APIs, and how
to use the individual components to build a custom tool.

The tutorial is sponsored by ECP, but open and available to all. Registration is
