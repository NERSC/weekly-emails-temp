## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Shelter-in-Place Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in California, which is under a 
statewide Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order for an indefinite period of time.
Under this Order, only essential businesses may remain open. NERSC is considered
an essential business due to its national importance, so we remain in operation,
but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. All trainings will be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.


### Vote Today for Your NUGEX Representatives! <a name="nugexelect"/></a> 

Voting is now open for six open positions on the NERSC User Group 
Executive Committee (NUGEX). NUGEX is the voice of the user community to NERSC 
and DOE, shaping and guiding important NERSC user policies. 

Please follow 
[this link](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fassessment_take2.do%3Fsysparm_assessable_type%3D3f0e20161b9c14102548ea82f54bcbc5) 
to vote for up to six candidates (NERSC login required). Hurry, voting ends on
May 8!


### Save the Date: NERSC User Group Annual Meeting Set for August 17 <a name="nugmtg"/></a> 

Mark your calendars for the annual meeting of the NERSC User Group (NUG), which
will be held online on Monday, August 17. More details on the schedule of events
are forthcoming.


### NERSC Users Group Special Interest Group on Experimental Facilities Created <a name="nugsig"/></a> 

The inaugural meeting of the NERSC Users Group (NUG) Special Interest Group 
(SIG) on Experimental Facilities took place last Wednesday, April 22, with a
discussion of plans and goals for the SIG and a presentation on best practices
for using NERSC. Outcomes of the meeting include:
- The creation of a web page covering the presented best-practices advice: 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/science-partners/bestpractices-eod/>. (Please note that 
NERSC documentation is hosted from an open 
[git repository](https://gitlab.com/NERSC/nersc.gitlab.io) and contributions 
are encouraged, so please feel free to share your own best practices!)
- A new channel on the NERSC Users Slack workspace, `#user-facilities`, for 
anyone interested in the SIG to join. (See the next entry for information on how
to join the NERSC Users Slack workspace.)

The SIG was formed in order to provide a forum NERSC users who process data from
experimental and observational facilities sponsored by the DOE Office of Science
to exchange best practices, knowledge, and tools. The group will also provide
feedback to NERSC staff on how to improve support for these workflows, and
provide input on policies that affect this growing workload at NERSC. To get
involved please join the channel and take a look at <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/sig-for-experimental-facility-users/> for regular updates.


### Join the NERSC Users Slack Sponsored by NUG Today! <a name="slack"/></a> 

Are you interested in discussing NERSC happenings and issues with your fellow
NERSC users? Do you want to get or give some advice from a user perspective 
about something in your workflow? If so, please join the NERSC Users Slack
workspace. For more information and a link to join, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/nersc-users-slack/> (login required).

**Please note that this Slack workspace is not an official NERSC staff-supported
platform.** While NERSC staff may sometimes join the NERSC Users Slack, the
best way to reach NERSC is still through the online help desk at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


### Share Your Research, Images, Movies, and Journal Covers with NERSC! <a name="share"/></a> 

NERSC is always looking for stories, images, movies, and journal cover stories 
related to research conducted at NERSC. Please tell us about your research using
the [NERSC Science Highlights Submission Form](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlight-submit/) 
and we could feature your work in our [news stories](https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/nersc-news/science-news/), 
[science highlight presentations](https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlights-presentations/), 
and/or other NERSC presentations and reports.


### VTune Profiler Default Upgraded to 2020 & All Older Versions Deprecated <a name="vtune"/></a> 

Last week, the Intel VTune profiler version default was upgraded to 
version 2020. Version 2020 includes significant upgrades in functionality and 
performance, and changes the names of the executables to simpler and 
easier-to-understand strings.

While the older versions (2018.up3 and 2019.up3) remain on Cori, we
encourage you to upgrade your workflow to `vtune/2020`. The deprecated versions
will no longer collect performance data, but can continue to be used to read
and analyze existing performance data that was collected with these tools.

For more information on using VTune at NERSC, please see the NERSC VTune 
documentation page at
<https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/performance-debugging-tools/vtune/>.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Registration Open for New User Training on June 10 <a name="newusertrain"/></a> 

Registration is now open for the NERSC New User Training that will be held 
online on Wednesday, June 10.

The purpose of the training is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on 
our computational systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, 
tools, and best practices; and data ecosystem.

**The training will be presented online only**, using Zoom technology.

Please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/new-user-training-june-10-2020/>
for the agenda and to register. 


### CUDA Training Series Continues May 13 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **This event will be held 
exclusively online.**

The fifth training in the series covers CUDA atomics, reductions, and warp 
shuffle. These operations can help you in cases where exposing parallelism is
not immediately obvious due to potential thread contention.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.

Registration for part 5 closes Wednesday, May 6. For more information (including
registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-atomics-reductions-and-warp-shuffle-part-5-of-9-cuda-training-series/>.

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- June 18: 6. [Managed Memory](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/managed-memory-part-6-of-9-cuda-training-series-june-18-2020/)
- July 21: 7. [CUDA Concurrency](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-concurrency-part-7-of-9-cuda-training-series-july-21-2020/)


### OpenACC Training Series Continues May 28 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

**NVIDIA will present a [3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)**
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **The May training will be online only.**

The May training covers data management in OpenACC. For more information and to
register, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/openacc-data-management-part-2-of-3-openacc-training-series-may-28-2020/>.

Remaining in the series:
- [Loop Optimizations with OpenACC (June 23)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/loop-optimizations-with-openacc-part-3-of-3-openacc-training-series-june-23-2020/)

Previously held sessions:
- [Introduction to OpenACC (April 17)](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-openacc-part-1-of-3-openacc-training-series-april-17-2020/)
