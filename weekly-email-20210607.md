## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under public health 
order restrictions through June 14. Upon the June 15 reopening of the 
California economy, we do not anticipate substantial changes to our operations, 
as we must continue to balance local, state, and Department of Energy safety 
requirements.

NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support but no 
telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Using the PSIP Toolkit on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/></a> 

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Using the PSIP Toolkit to Achieve your Goals -- A Case 
study at The HDF Group",
and will take place **this Wednesday, June 9, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

This webinar, presented by Elena Pourmal (The HDF Group), Reed Milewicz (Sandia 
National Labs), and Elsa Gonsiorowski (Lawrence Livermore National Lab), will
provide an overview of the PSIP methodology and toolkit, and describe how the
HDF5 Group used PSIP to make improvements in three key areas of their software
development process.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/psip4hdf/).


### Introducing Appentra Parallelware Office Hours this Wednesday, June 9 <a name="parallelware"/></a> 

[Appentra](https://www.appentra.com) produces the Parallelware tools, aimed at
helping software developers build better quality parallel software in less time.
The [Parallelware Analyzer]()
tool detects and helps to fix defects related to parallelism with OpenMP and
OpenACC, and identifies opportunities for OpenMP/OpenACC parallelization on
CPUs and GPUs.
[Parallelware Trainer]()
is an Integrated Development Environment designed to facilitate the learning,
usage, and implementation of OpenMP/OpenACC parallel programming, along with the
ability to test the performance improvements of particular parallel
implementations.

NERSC has offered trainings on using these tools in
[2019](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-tool-workshop-october-17/)
and
[2020](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-training-series-oct-nov-2020/). 
Now Appentra staff are back at NERSC for virtual office hours, to be held **this
Wednesday, June 9, from 9 am to noon (Pacific time)**. Users who are interested 
in getting started or who have already used the tools but have questions are
invited to drop in at any time during the event. For more information please see
the event webpage at <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-office-hours-june-9-2021/>
and [add the event to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=N3EydWEzOTh2OGk5YmEydXFjbjFkOXEwZWUgbGJsLmdvdl9sczBnZHRnaTdiOTNqcmVkbGVzMGlibDB1NEBn&tmsrc=lbl.gov_ls0gdtgi7b93jredles0ibl0u4%40group.calendar.google.com).


### Crash Course in Supercomputing, this Friday, June 11 <a name="crashcourse"/></a> 

NERSC invites those with an interest in or just beginning to write parallel
programs to join our one-day Crash Course in Supercomputing **this Friday, 
June 11.** The course will be held from **10 am to noon and 1-3 pm (Pacific 
time).**

In this two-part course, students will learn to write parallel programs that
can be run on a supercomputer. We begin by discussing the concepts of 
parallelization before introducing MPI and OpenMP, the two leading parallel 
programming libraries. Finally, the students will put together all the concepts 
from the class by programming, compiling, and running a parallel code on one of 
the NERSC supercomputers. Training accounts will be provided for students who 
have not yet set up a NERSC account.

For more information and to register, please see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/crash-course-supercomputing-june-2021/>.

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
assembled, and booting. We continue configuring and testing the machine. NERSC 
staff are in the beginning stages of setting up the software environment. Some
test jobs with real user applications are being run. Preliminary 
[Perlmutter Documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) 
is under development. As we progress, this newsletter item will be updated.


### (NEW) Perlmutter Availability Access Plan <a name="pmaccess"/></a> 

Perlmutter is currently unavailable to users. We do not have a set date for
allowing the first wave of users onto the machine, but when the machine is
suitable for its first users, we will add users in stages. The order of access 
is outlined at <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/#access>.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Cori Operating System Upgrade & New Default Enivronment Coming in August or September <a name="osupgrade"/></a> 

To continue to be in compliance with minimum requirements for support from
HPE/Cray, NERSC will perform a minor version upgrade to the operating system on
Cori later this year. The upgrade itself is currently expected to take only one 
day, but we will analyze the required steps further, and may extend the estimate
if necessary.

At the same time, we will also **update the default user programming 
environment** on Cori for the first time since January, 2020. The precise CDT 
version we will install is still to be determined. We expect that the changes 
to the operating system and default programming environment will at a minimum
require users to relink all statically compiled codes, and NERSC plans to 
update all NERSC-supported software to be compatible with the new operating 
system and CDT at that time.

The precise date of the upgrade is also still to be determined, but we expect 
that it will be performed during one of the regular monthly maintenance periods 
in August or September.


### Cori "Compile" Queue Now Available to All Users <a name="compileq"/></a> 

The "compile" QOS on Cori is now open to all users! The 
[compile QOS](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#compile) is intended for 
workflows that regularly compile codes from source, e.g., DevOps models 
leveraging Continuous Integration. There is a single Cori Haswell node allocated
to compile QOS jobs, and there is no charge for these jobs.


### NERSC Electrical Systems Maintenance Weekend of July 10 <a name="mvsgmaint"/></a> 

NERSC will have an electrical-systems maintenance the weekend of July 10. The 
medium-voltage switchgear that transforms power from transmission voltage to 
usable voltage will undergo a required inspection and maintenance. This means
that **nearly all NERSC resources will be unavailable during the maintenance.**
The medium-voltage switchgear maintenance itself is scheduled for July 10, and 
NERSC may perform additional maintenance tasks while everything is already down.
More details will be provided as we create a more detailed schedule.


### (NEW) New NERSC Appointments on Checkpoint/Restart Now Available! <a name="appointments"/></a> 

NERSC provides 25-minute appointments with user support consultants on a range
of topics.

In addition to the already existing NERSC 101, KNL Optimization, Containers,
File Systems, GPU Basics, and Using GPUs in Python categories, we now offer
**Checkpoint/Restart**, for advice on using checkpoint/restart with MANA to
allow flexible run times.

For more information on appointments, please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/help/#appointments-with-nersc-user-support-staff>.
Appointments can be scheduled at <https://nersc.as.me/schedule.php>.


### Preparation Work for Community File System Expansion Ongoing <a name="cfsupdate"/></a> 

The Community File System will be expanded later this year. As part of this 
process, a behind-the-scenes data migration is taking place to new hardware. We 
don't anticipate much performance impact, but wanted to share this news with 
users. Stay tuned for more updates about this expansion as we advance to the 
next steps later this year.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section6"/></a> ##

### Training on Lmod, New Module Environment for Perlmutter, June 22 <a name="lmodtrain"/></a> 

Lmod is a Lua-based module system, with more features than the traditional
TCL-based module system. The new Perlmutter system will use Lmod as the primary
interface for interacting with module files.

NERSC is offering a hands-on Lmod training on **Tuesday, June 22, from 10 
am-noon (Pacific time)**. This trianing will walk users through the new features
and usage of Lmod.

For more information and to register, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/lmod-user-training/>.


### (NEW) CUDA Multithreading with Streams Training, July 16 <a name="custreams"/></a> 

As a continuation of last year's popular 
[CUDA Training Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/),
NVIDIA will present a session on "CUDA Multithreading with Streams" to NERSC and
OLCF users on Friday, July 16, 2021, from 10 am to noon (Pacific time).

CUDA streams are useful for achieving concurrency and ensuring an application is
fully utilizing the GPU. However, many GPU-accelearated applications start off
as multi-threaded CPU applications. In this module, we will explore the
combination of GPU concurrency and a multi-threaded context, such as an OpenMP
application. Following the presentation there will be a hands-on session for
participants to complete example exercises to observe the impact of changes on
application performance. NERSC will provide access to its Cori-GPU system for
current NERSC users.

Registration is required for remote participation. For more information and to
register please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-multithreading-with-streams-july-16-2021/>.
