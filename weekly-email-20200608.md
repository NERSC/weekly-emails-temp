## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### New User Training Rescheduled for Tuesday, June 16 <a name="newusertrain"/></a> 

*The NERSC New User Training, originally scheduled for this Wednesday, has been
rescheduled for Tuesday, June 16, due to a conflict with the [Science Strike for
Black Lives](https://www.particlesforjustice.org/) that was impacting several
participants as well as NERSC staff.*

Join us for the NERSC New User Training that will be held online next Tuesday,
June 16.

The purpose of the training is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on 
our computational systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, 
tools, and best practices; and data ecosystem.

**The training will be presented online only**, using Zoom technology.

Please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/new-user-training-june-16-2020/>
for the agenda and to register.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Planned Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources June 25-29 <a name="powerupgrade"/></a> 

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a three-day weekend outage,
is scheduled for June 26-29. An additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled 
for September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed From Friday, June 26 to Sunday,
June 29. In preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning 
on Thursday, June 25. Power will be restored on or before Monday, June 29, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time) on
Thursday, June 25, to 6:00 pm on Monday, June 29.

This was previously published as a two-day weekend outage, but due to increased
safety requirements, had to be expanded to a three-day outage. We appreciate
your flexibility under these unusual circumstances.


### New Kubernetes-Based Spin Instance Now Available for Early Access <a name="k8sspin"/></a> 

Spin is a container-based platform at NERSC designed for you to deploy your own 
science gateways, workflow managers, databases, API endpoints, and other network
services to support your scientific projects.

Early access is now available to a new instance of Spin based on the popular 
Kubernetes system.

Current Spin users may request access by submitting a NERSC ticket, indicating:

`I'm a current Spin user and would like access to Rancher 2.
The NERSC project(s) associated with my use of Spin are ___, ...`

New Spin users may apply to attend one of several upcoming workshops.

apply!


### New Look to NERSC Online Help Desk; Additional Upgrade During Sitewide Outage <a name="helpnewlook"/></a> 

The NERSC online helpdesk (<https://help.nersc.gov/>) now has a new look and
feel based on the NERSC color palette and an update to a new version. (Don't see
it yet? Log out and log back in.)

We will again upgrade the online help desk in conjunction with the sitewide 
power outage. You can expect a 3-hour outage on the Friday morning of the
outage (currently planned for Friday, June 26, from 9 am to noon Pacific time).

### CUDA Training Series Continues Next Thursday <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The sixth training in the series covers CUDA managed memory. The system can
automatically migrate data between the host and device as necessary. Learn how
to allocate managed memory, as well as how to use it to store data structures
that might otherwise be difficult to manage manually in a heterogeneous system.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/managed-memory-part-6-of-9-cuda-training-series-june-18-2020/>

Other scheduled dates in the series:
- July 21: 7. [CUDA Concurrency](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-concurrency-part-7-of-9-cuda-training-series-july-21-2020/)


### OpenACC Training Series Concludes June 23 <a name="openacc"/></a> 

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

NVIDIA will present a 
[3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **All training sessions will be online 
only.**

The final training covers loop optimizations with OpenACC. For more information 
and to register, please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/loop-optimizations-with-openacc-part-3-of-3-openacc-training-series-june-23-2020/>
