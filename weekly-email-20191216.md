## Limited Consulting and Account Support over the Holidays <a name="holiday"/></a> ##

During the upcoming festive season (which is December 24, 2019 to January 1, 
2020 as observed by Berkeley Lab), Consulting and Account support will be
generally unavailable. On Friday, December 27 and Monday, December 30, there
will be limited Consulting and Account support. The consultant on duty will
answer any urgent queries, but queries of lower priority may not be taken up
until regular service resumes.


## New Allocation Year Begins January 14, 2020 <a name="neway"/></a> ##

The 2020 Allocation Year (AY) begins on January 14, 2020. There will be several
changes that will take effect in the new AY. Of note:
- The software environment defaults will change, as outlined in the [NERSC CDT
Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/Cray-PE-CDT-policy/);
- The default Python module will point to a version of Python 3;
- The new Community File System (CFS) will replace the Project File System;
- NERSC will have a new software policy, providing more clarity on how we
support software on Cori and future machines.

More details about the AY transition can be found at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/announcements/allocation-year-transition-2019-to-2020/>.


## CUDA Training Series Begins January 15 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> ##

NVIDIA will present a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture (for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote 
participants).  OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each 
part of the series.

The first training in the series will take place on January 15, 2020, from 10 am
to 12 pm (Pacific time). This training will introduce participants to CUDA C++,
an extension of C++ that allows developers to program GPUs with a familiar
programming language and simple APIs. Participants will learn basic concepts, 
syntax, and APIs needed to transfer data to and from GPUs, write GPU kernels,
and manage GPU thread groups. Following the presentation will be a hands-on
session where in-person participants can complete example exercises meant to
reinforce the presented concepts.

For more information (including registration information) please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/introduction-to-cuda-c-part-1-of-9-cuda-training-series/>.

## New Community File System to Replace Project File System in New Allocation Year <a name="cfs"/></a> ##

The new "Community" File System (CFS) will replace the Project file system in
the new allocation year (AY). No action is required for users; NERSC will
transfer your data from Project to CFS.

Each active repository will have a directory on CFS with the path structure
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<repo_name>`, but existing 
`/global/project/projectdirs/<repo_name>` paths will redirect to the
corresponding CFS path until mid-2020.

Last week's [NUG meeting](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-dec-12-2019/)
included more information about CFS and the migration timeline, and last week's
NERSC User News [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Community-File-System-Kristy-Kallback-Rose--Greg-Butler--and-Ravi-Cheema-Interview-e9d88q/a-a149hf5) 
was on the topic of CFS.


## Will Your Science Gateway Be Affected by the Community File System Sync? <a name="scigateway"/></a> ##

Developers of science gateways should be aware of the upcoming replacement of 
the NERSC Project File System (Project) with the new Community File System (CFS)
and the effect this may have on science gateways. Files on Project will be 
automatically transferred to CFS in a multiday sync, which is scheduled to occur
January 14-21. During that time, Project will be set to read-only. Any science 
gateways that need to write to Project will therefore be subject to breakage 
during that time. We recognize that this will be an inconvenience and that some 
gateway sites will temporarily lose functionality. Unfortunately, this is 
inevitable. If your gateway's inability to write to Project during the sync will
cause serious problems, please file a ServiceNow ticket with details about your 
gateway by December 20, so that the science gateways team can help you find a 
workaround. 

Once the data transfer is complete, we will immediately update the web server so
that URLs like `https://portal.nersc.gov/project/myprojectdir` will again work 
as before but will then point to the new location on CFS. We will also enable a 
similar request-handling mechanism so that requests for URLs like 
`https://portal.nersc.gov/cfs/myprojectdir` will retrieve files from directories
like `/global/cfs/cdirs/myprojectdir`. We recommend directing your traffic to 
the new `/cfs` URLs, since users will more readily recognize it as data on the 
community file system. 

If any of this needs further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out,
and we will work with you to ensure a smooth migration path. 


## ALCC Letters of Intent Due TODAY! <a name="alcc"/></a> ##

For the 2020-2021 ALCC campaign, PIs are **required** to submit a Letter of 
Intent (LOI) as the first step of submitting a proposal. The ALCC submission 
site (<https://science.osti.gov/ascr/ALCC>) opened October 1,
with LOIs due **today**.

All proposals are due when the submission site closes at 11:59 PM (Eastern Time)
on February 3, 2020. Information from the LOI will be automatically populated to
the proposal by December 18. Details about submission requirements can be found 
at <https://science.osti.gov/ascr/Facilities/Accessing-ASCR-Facilities/ALCC>.


## New Programing Environments Now Available on Cori <a name="corisw"/></a> ##

NERSC installed the new Cray Programming Environment Software release CDT/19.11
during the most recent maintenance. While there was no software default version 
changes made, CDT/19.11 is expected to become the default in the new allocation 
year and [dynamic linking](#dynamic) will become default. Please see the 
detailed list of new software at
<https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2019Dec-2020Jan>.

Cray compiler users shoule note the important information about the all-new CCE 
9.0 on the above webpage; in particular the CCE 9.0 C/C++ compiler is based on 
Clang instead of the classic Cray compiler. Key consequences of these changes 
include:
- CCE 9.0 compilers are not compatible with pre-CDT-19.06 library versions (such
as MPI);
- The OpenMP flag is no longer turned on by default.


## Dynamic Linking to Become Default on Jan 14, 2020; Test Now! <a name="dynamic"/></a> ##

We plan to set the new CDT/19.11 as default (assuming no major issues are 
discovered beforehand) at the time of the Allocation Year transition on 
**January 14, 2020**.

When this happens, the **default linking mode on Cori will change from static to
dynamic**. We encourage users to test this change now and [let us know](https://help.nersc.gov) 
if you encounter any issues. 

We encourage you to start testing dynamic linking with:

```
% module load cdt/19.11 
% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
```
and proceeding to compile and run your code.

If, after the default changes, you prefer to use static linking as default 
(e.g., for workflow or performance reasons), you can set: 

```
% export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=static   
```
to retain static linking.


## User Dotfile Changes Planned for February 2020 <a name="dotfiles"/></a> ##

Currently, by default, `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`/`.cshrc`/`.login` files are 
symlinks in your `$HOME` to read-only NERSC-supplied startup files. You may have
made changes to your starting environment by adding 
`.bashrc.ext`/`.bash_profile.ext`/`.cshrc.ext`/`.login.ext` files.

To reduce some shell startup overhead, and to bring NERSC in line with most 
other HPC centers, we will migrate away from this arrangement during the 
scheduled maintenance in **February 2020**. After the change is made, you will 
be able to edit `.bashrc` (etc) directly.

During the change, your `.bashrc` (etc), which is currently a symlink, will be 
replaced by a template `.bashrc` (etc) that simply sources your `.bashrc.ext` 
(etc).

For most users this should have no other impact. But some non-default 
environments and workflows might experience some changes to their environment. 
You can test the changes now, by using the `dotmgr` command and logging in to 
cori12 or dtn12, which now have the new configuration:

    `dotmgr -l` # list my current dotfiles
    `dotmgr -s` # save my current dotfiles, and print the location
    `dotmgr -e` # replace my existing dotfiles with the new arrangement

You can then login to cori12 and/or dtn12 to check whether this affected your 
environment. Check that things still look the same and your aliases still work.

    `ssh cori12`

You can then return your dotfiles to the current configuration with:

    `dotmgr -r <directory-that-the-save-step-returned>`

Note that `dotmgr -e` and `dotmgr -r` **don't affect your current environment** 
-- they affect the contents of your dotfiles. For the changes to take effect, 
you must log out and log back in.

For detailed help, please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/>.
Please let us know of any problems you encounter, by filing a ticket at 
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## Call For Papers: Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC Forum (P3HPC) <a name="p3hpc"/></a> ##

The call for papers for the Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC 
Forum (P3HPC) is now open. This workshop is an opportunity for
researchers to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for 
tackling the compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance, 
portability and productivity.
 
We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of 
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composability challenges 
arising from the use of bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" 
applications in the long term.

Submissions close January 24, 2020. For more information and to submit a paper,
please see <https://p3hpcforum2020.alcf.anl.gov/>.


## NERSC Will Support Only Python3 in New Allocation Year <a name="python2"/></a> ##

Python 2 will reach its end of life on [January 1, 
2020](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches),
at which point there will be no more development, bug fixes, patches, etc.

Therefore, upon the beginning of the 2020 Allocation Year at NERSC, the 
following changes to Python support will occur at NERSC:
- At the AY rollover, the default Python module will become a module based on a
Python 3 distribution.
- The old Python 2 module will remain available for use but users must specify
the version suffix.
- No new installations of Python 2 packages or modules will be performed.
- During the next Cori operating system upgrade, which could occur sometime in
2020, the Python 2 module will be retired.

NERSC will actively support only Python 3 (or future Python versions should
Python 3 become deprecated) on Perlmutter and future systems.

Please let us know your questions via a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov>.
