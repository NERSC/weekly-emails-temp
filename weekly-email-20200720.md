## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### CUDA Training Series Continues July 21 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The seventh training in the series, to be held on Tuesday, July 21, covers 
CUDA concurrency. Concurrency refers to the ability to perform multiple CUDA 
operations simultaneously. Learn about CUDA streams and asynchronous functions 
that can be used to do things like run multiple kernels on a single GPU or 
overlap data transfer and computation.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-concurrency-part-7-of-9-cuda-training-series-july-21-2020/>.

Future scheduled events:
- August 18: [GPU Performance Analysis](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/gpu-performance-analysis-part-8-of-9-cuda-training-series-august-18-2020/)
- September 17: [Cooperative Groups](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cooperative-groups-part-9-of-9-cuda-training-series-september-17-2020/)


### JupyterCon 2020 Call for Proposals Extended - Closes July 22 <a name="jupytercon"/></a> 

JupyterCon 2020 will be held online, October 5-17.  With over 700 unique users 
per month accessing NERSC through Jupyter it has become quite apparent that 
Jupyter has become a critical platform for access to high-performance computing 
and data storage resources.  We would like to encourage users of Jupyter at 
NERSC to submit proposals for presentations, lightning talks, or online posters 
at 
<https://jupytercon.com/participate/#Call%20for%20proposals>

The call for proposals closes at 11:59pm AoE on July 22, 2020, and notifications will be sent
on August 10. Presenters of 30-minute conference talks are eligible for a free
pass to the main conference week.

Attending JupyterCon (virtually) would be a great way for NERSC users to gain a 
broader perspective on the Jupyter ecosystem and become power users.  For more 
background on JupyterCon 2020 and JupyterCon in general, please see:
- <https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytercon-online-more-than-a-conference-4677cf25a915>
- <https://jupytercon.com/>

We (at NERSC) hope to see you at JupyterCon 2020!


### Register Now for Online User Training on VASP on Thursday July 23, 2020 <a name="vasptrain"/></a> 

NERSC will host a 1-hour online VASP user training on Thursday July 23, 2020, 
from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm Pacific time. The training will focus on higher order 
methods and will be instructed by Dr. Martijn Masman at VASP Software GmbH. 
Please register [here](https://forms.gle/DLVVWFERasiS45J1A). Remote connection 
info is available 
[here](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/vasp-user-training-on-july-23-2020/).  


### Kokkos Lecture Series, Continues Friday July 24 <a name="kokkos"/></a> 

Kokkos is a C++ programming model for performance portability that allows 
developers to implement their applications in a single-source fashion, with
hardware vendor-agnostic programming patterns.

If you've been curious about how to write code with Kokkos, now is your chance!
The Kokkos team is providing its first **Kokkos Lecture Series**, which started 
thispast Friday July 17, and continues this Friday July 24. The series consists
of a two-hour online lecture every Friday through early September, with exercises
as homework. The team will provide support via GitHub and Slack throughout the
series.

**There are a limited number of seats available, so registration is 
recommended.** (Please note that although this is 
an ECP-sponsored training, registration is open to all.) For more information 
and to register, please see 
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/kokkos-class-series/>.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Videos from June New Users Training Now Available <a name="newuservideos"/></a> 

Did you miss the new users training last month? Are you interested in brushing
up on the basics about NERSC?

The training for new users presented on June 16 was recorded, and videos
from the training are now available. To view the playlist on YouTube, please
visit 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSsFDfNrshVdiaQKZK4CNFq7>.

## Calls for Participation <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Register for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting on August 17 <a name="nugmtg"/></a> 

Registration is now open for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting, which is being
held online on Monday, August 17. An agenda for the meeting is published, and
includes time for short user talks. **If you are interested in speaking, please
include an abstract when you fill out your registration form.**

For more information and to register please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/annual-meetings/nug-2020/>.


### Interactive HPC 2020 <a name="interactivehpc"/></a> 

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent HPC-based 
workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.  The real-time 
QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and observational data 
workloads.  Jupyter has become a major point of entry and platform for interactive 
ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd like to 
share with the world?  Then please consider submitting a paper to the Fourth 
Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020.  Position 
papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome (up to 10 
pages).  The workshop itself will be held November 15 or 16, in conjunction with 
SuperComputing 2020.  The exact date and location are TBD since the event may be 
virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  More details on the workshop and submission 
instructions are at: https://www.interactivehpc.com/


### Apply Today for the SC20 Early Career Program <a name="scearlycareer"/></a> 

Are you an early-career researcher, educator, or technical professional who
wants to develop professional skills and a strategic vision for your career in
high-performance computing? If so, consider applying for the SC20 Early Career
Program!

In this program, attendees participate in early career sessions on Monday,
November 16, 2020 -- before the full SC20 program begins, allowing you to
participate in as much of the Technical Program as possible.

For more information and to apply, please see: <https://sc20.supercomputing.org/submit/early-career-applications/>.
Applications close July 31!
