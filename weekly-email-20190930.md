## New Requirement for ALCC Proposals <a name="alcc"/></a> ##

For the 2020-2021 ALCC campaign, PIs are **required** to submit a Letter of 
Intent (LOI) as the first step of submitting a proposal. The ALCC submission 
site (<https://science.osti.gov/ascr/ALCC>) opens tomorrow (October 1) at noon, 
with LOIs due on December 16. 

All proposals are due when the submission site closes at 11:59 PM (Eastern Time)
on February 3, 2020. Information from the LOI will be automatically populated to
the proposal by December 18. Details about submission requirements can be found 
at <https://science.osti.gov/ascr/Facilities/Accessing-ASCR-Facilities/ALCC>.


## Potential Impacts on NERSC from California Wildfire Season <a name="fireseason"/></a> ##

PG&E, which provides power to Berkeley Lab (and NERSC), is taking a more
conservative approach to wildfire prevention, which may result in power lines
being de-energized and the power to the NERSC machine room being cut with little
advance notice. While the chances are low that this will happen, NERSC has
plans for shutting down Cori smoothly (with enough advance warning) and
informing users. Users can also look at <http://status.lbl.gov/> to find out the
latest status of NERSC as well as Berkeley Lab as a whole.


## Appentra Parallelware Tool Training on October 17! <a name="parallelware"/></a> ##

NERSC is always looking for new ways to improve user experience while coding.
One ever-present challenge in high-performance computing is how to parallelize 
your code to improve on-node or offload performance. Many users struggle with
getting this right. Fortunately, Appentra has developed the 
[Parallelware](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/) Trainer
Tool to teach you!

NERSC has partnered with Appentra to offer a one-day training for users to get
more familiar with this new tool. This training, which will be taught by 
Appentra founder Manuel Arneaz, will be offered on Thursday, October 17 at 
NERSC. It will begin with an overview of the tool and how to use it, and 
continue with a hands-on session for the remainder of the day.

Registration information and agenda for the day are available at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-tool-workshop-october-17>.


## Videos from June Appentra Parallelware Trainer Tool Training Now Available <a name="parallelwarevideos"/></a> ##

Did you miss the Appentra Parallelware Trainer tool training in June? Are you 
interested in brushing up on the basics about the tool before the training in
October?

The training presented on June 6 was recorded, and videos from the training are 
now available. To view the playlist on YouTube, please visit 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSvHYFsARV8bPUwwBm2xQh1A>.


## Join Us for ERCAP Virtual Office Hours in September and October <a name="ercapofficehrs"/></a> ##

Allocations staff are holding virtual office hours via Zoom from 8:00 am to 5:00
pm (Pacific time) to assist users finishing up their ERCAP requests, which
are due on October 7.

Virtual office hours will be held on the following dates:
- This Wednesday, October 2
- This Friday, October 4
- Monday, October 7 (ERCAP due date)

Sharing video will make it easier for allocations staff to help troubleshoot 
user issues. Join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/my/ercap.office.hours> during
office hours to get some help!


## ERCAP Submissions Due Next Monday, October 7! <a name="ercap"/></a> ##

Submissions for the 2020 ERCAP allocations process are now open. Requests
will be accepted through next Monday, October 7. NERSC is holding [ERCAP 
Office Hours](#ercapoffichrs) via Zoom to assist users with submitting their 
requests.

Please listen to this NERSC User News [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l)
for more information about ERCAP.


## Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Closing October 15 <a name="bssw"/></a> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a
workshop or tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software
community.

For more information and to apply, please see <https://bssw.io/fellowship>.
Applications are due Tuesday, October 15. 


## Sign up Now for UPC++ Workshop on November 1 at NERSC! <a name="upcpp"/></a> ##

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support 
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms 
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through 
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous 
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing 
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or 
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to 
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this tutorial we will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization 
techniques of UPC++. We will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and 
walk through implementing basic algorithms in UPC++. We will also look at 
irregular applications and how to take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize 
their performance.

This event can be attended on-site at NERSC or remotely via Zoom. The remote 
connection information will be provided to the registrants closer to the event. 
[Registration](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/upc/) is required for this 
event and space is limited so please register as soon as possible. Registration 
closes when the limit is reached or on October 18, 2019.


## NERSC Will Support Only Python3 in New Allocation Year <a name="python2"/></a> ##

Python 2 will reach its end of life on [January 1, 2020](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches),
at which point there will be no more development, bug fixes, patches, etc.

Therefore, upon the beginning of the 2020 Allocation Year at NERSC, the 
following changes to Python support will occur at NERSC:
- At the AY rollover, the default Python module will become a module based on a
Python 3 distribution.
- The old Python 2 module will remain available for use but users must specify
the version suffix.
- No new installations of Python 2 packages or modules will be performed.
- During the next Cori operating system upgrade, which could occur sometime in
2020, the Python 2 module will be retired.

NERSC will actively support only Python 3 (or future Python versions should
Python 3 become deprecated) on Perlmutter and future systems.

Please let us know your questions via a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov>.
