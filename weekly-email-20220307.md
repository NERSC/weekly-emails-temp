## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing Application Deadline Extended to Today! <a name="atpesc"/></a> 

Are you a doctoral student, postdoc, or computational scientist looking for
advanced training on the key skills, approaches, and tools to design, implement,
and execute computational science and engineering applications on current
high-end computing systems and the leadership-class computing systems of the
future? If so, consider applying for the Argonne Training Program on
Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC) program. 

The core of the two-week program focuses on programming methodologies that are
effective across a variety of supercomputers and applicable to exascale systems.
Additional topics to be covered include computer architectures, mathematical
models and numerical algorithms, approaches to building community codes for HPC
systems, and methodologies and tools relevant for Big Data applications. This
year's program will be held July 31-August 12 in the Chicago area. There is no 
cost to attend. Domestic airfare, meals, and lodging are provided.

**The application deadline was extended to today, March 7, 2021**.


### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on "Software Design Patterns in Research Software with Examples from OpenFOAM" on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar2"/></a> 

The March webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Software Design Patterns in Research Software with
Examples from OpenFOAM",
and will take place **this Wednesday, March 9, at 10:00 am Pacific time.**

In this webinar, Tomislav Marc (TU Darmstadt)
will discuss beneficial software design patterns that provide a solid basis for 
developing numerical methods in a modular way, drawing concrete examples from
OpenFOAM, a highly modular open-source software for Computational Fluid
Dynamics.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/design-patterns/).

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
running user jobs. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, is beginning to
arrive next month. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be 
taken out of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take 
up to 8 weeks. We are developing a plan for integration that will reduce the
amount of time the entire system is down. We will let you know when this plan is
finalized.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Reduction in Perlmutter Node Availability during Cooling System Physical Maintenance <a name="pmcooling"/></a> 

The Perlmutter Phase 1 system, which is currently in its early user 
pre-production stage, requires physical maintenance of the cooling system that 
will take up to 6 weeks to complete. Rather than shut down the entire machine, 
NERSC will perform the maintenance in a rolling fashion with the aim of 
keeping 500 or more nodes available to users. Occasionally, some jobs may see 
decreased GPU performance during this time. We will try to keep as much of the 
system available as possible, but please understand that Perlmutter is not yet 
a production resource with any uptime guarantees.


### (NEW) Perlmutter Maintenances, Explained <a name="pmmaint"/></a> 

Perlmutter is currently undergoing a fortnightly maintenance schedule. You may
have noticed that while some of the maintenances require a system downtime,
others are rolling updates where the only disruption to users is brief
disconnections from login nodes and the possibility of a longer job start-up
time.

New system management technology allows us to perform all but the most invasive
of operations on a rolling basis. We will use this technology to minimize (but
likely not completely eliminate) Perlmutter downtime.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Cori OS Upgrade and New Default Environment Next Wednesday <a name="coriosupgrade"/></a> 

In order to remain in compliance with minimum requirements for support from
HPE/Cray, Cori will undergo an **operating system (OS) upgrade during the
scheduled maintenance next Wednesday, March 16, 2022.**

At that time, we will also update the default user programming environment on
Cori for the first time since January 2020. The default Cray Developer 
Toolkit (CDT) version will change from 19.11 to **22.02** (note new version), 
and the Intel compiler default will change from 19.0.3.199 to 19.1.2.254. A 
detailed list of software changes (including cray-mpich, cray-libsci, 
cray-netcdf, cray-hdf5, gcc, cce, intel, perftools, etc.) can be found 
[here](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2022Mar/).
NERSC-supported software will be updated to be compatible with the new OS and
CDT. Users will need to relink all statically compiled codes. We also highly
recommend rebuilding all your applications.


### E4S Updates <a name="e4s"/></a> 

#### E4S Versions 20.10 & 21.02 Will Be Deprecated upon Cori OS Upgrade 

Due to the [upgrade of the operating system on Cori next week](#coriosupgrade), 
the two earliest E4S versions on Cori, 20.10 and 21.02, will be deprecated at 
that time. The module files for these versions have been updated to inform you 
of this change. We encourage you to start using newer versions of E4S at this 
time.

#### E4S Version 21.11 Available on Perlmutter

We are pleased to announce that the E4S/21.11 software stack has been rebuilt
for Perlmutter using GCC version 9.3.0 and NVIDIA version 21.9. We have deployed
a subset of the most commonly used elements of the software stack. It is
accessible via `module load e4s/21.11-tcl` or `module load e4s/21.11-lmod`. Both
point to the same spack instance but employ two different types of module trees.

In addition, we have released instructions on using a containerized
deployment of E4S via Shifter. The container, provided by the E4S team, 
includes the full E4S software stack built on Ubuntu 20.04.

For more information, please see the E4S documentation at
<https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/e4s/perlmutter/21.11/>.

### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts April 20! <a name="spinup"/></a> 

Spin is a service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. New large-memory nodes have been added to the platform, increasing the
potential of the platform for new memory-constrained applications.
To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
on [Wednesday, April 20](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/spin/)
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend an instructional session and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

If you can't make these upcoming sessions, never fear! The next session begins
