## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.


### Potential Impacts on NERSC from California Wildfire Season <a name="pspswarn"/></a> 

PG&E, which provides power to Berkeley Lab (and NERSC), continues with its 
conservative approach to wildfire prevention this year: de-energizing
transmission power lines in areas with acute wildfire risk. This practice may 
result in the power to the NERSC machine room being cut with little advance 
notice. During one of these events, NERSC will fall to generator power, which is
not sufficient to power Cori, but will keep auxiliary, non-compute systems
online. We will keep users informed about what's going on at NERSC, including
any information about when we will come back online. Users can also consult 
<http://status.lbl.gov/> to find out the latest status of NERSC as well as 
Berkeley Lab as a whole.

Berkeley Lab was placed on a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) **watch** status
for this evening through Wednesday morning. However, PG&E informed Lab 
emergency management leadership that **the Lab is not in one of the areas
currently targeted for shutoff.**

While this particular PSPS event is unlikely to affect NERSC, from September 
to early November there is a small but persistent chance of a PSPS event 
impacting NERSC on any given day. Based on last year's experience, NERSC may
have less than 48 hours notice to shut down. We therefore recommend that users
with time-sensitive tasks allow additional time to accommodate potential power 
outages, if possible. Users with long jobs (i.e., jobs exceeding 24 hours
walltime) should be prepared for the risk of interruption. We recommend
implementing [checkpointing](https://docs.nersc.gov/development/checkpoint-restart/dmtcp/) 
for long jobs to assure that some progress can be saved from a PSPS disruption. 
If you have any questions about the potential impact of PSPS events on your 
work, please send in a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov>.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Labor Day Holiday Today; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="laborday"/></a> 

Consulting and account support will be unavailable today, September 7 due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed Labor Day holiday. Regular consulting and account
support will resume tomorrow. Operations staff are available for urgent
queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all times.


### Apply for Sustainable Research Pathways Workshop 2020 by Friday! <a name="srp2021"/></a> 

Are you a full-time faculty member at a US institution (including 
minority-serving institutions, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges) 
supporting students such as women, minorities, first-generation scholars, and 
people with disabilities, who is interested in a virtual research experience 
alongside Berkeley Lab Computing Sciences (including NERSC) staff?

If so, consider applying for the Sustainable Research Pathways Workshop 
(SRP) 2020. During the workshop, participating faculty will learn of funding
opportunities to participate in Berkeley Lab's 2021 summer research program.

For more information and to apply, please visit the 
[SRP Program Page](http://shinstitute.org/srp-application/). Applications are
due **this Friday, September 11.**


### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Testing & Code Review Practices in Research Software Development on Wednesday <a name="ecpwebinar"/></a> 

The September webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Testing and Code Review Practices in Research Software 
Development" and will take place this Wednesday, September 9, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Nasir Eisty (California Polytechnic State University,
San Luis Obispo), will cover the use of two software quality practices in the
development of research software: software testing and peer code review. These
practices can lead to not only improved scientific results through higher 
quality software in the short term, but also more maintainable software in the 
long term. Learn about the challenges, barriers, and necessary improvements to
make the practices effective for research software development, based on studies
of the research software community conducted via interviews, surveys, workshops,
and tutorials.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://exascaleproject.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIscu-rpz8tHSl-MeswznBzjweQ4c9fR2s).

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources October 7-12 <a name="powerupgrade"/></a> 

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one was held July 10-13. 
**A second outage is now scheduled for October 7-12.**

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first components of which will begin to arrive later in October.

More details will be provided in future communications.


### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Is Open! <a name="ercap"/></a> 

The ERCAP allocations process has now begun accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY). Requests will be accepted through Monday, October 5, 2020.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen 
to [this podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l). 

Please join us for virtual [office hours](#ercapofficehrs) next Thursday.


### Join Us for ERCAP Office Hours! <a name="ercapofficehrs"/></a> 

Allocations staff will once again hold virtual office hours via Zoom to assist
users with finishing up and submitting their ERCAP requests, on the following
dates:
- Thursday, September 17
- Thursday, October 1
- Monday, October 5 (ERCAP due date)

Office hours will take place from 9-11 am and 2-4 pm (Pacific
time). Please join the Zoom meeting via [this link](https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/7314990879?pwd=Z1B6UnRjaEVSeFNUb1hCSUFTWjE2dz09), 
or type the meeting number (7314990879) and password (NERSC) into your Zoom app.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### CUDA Training Series Concludes Next Thursday, September 17 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The ninth and final training in the series, to be held next Thursday, September 
17, covers cooperative groups -- a flexible model for thread synchronization 
both within and across thread blocks, which enables the writing of a wide range 
of parallel algorithms in a composable and well-defined manner.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts. 

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cooperative-groups-part-9-of-9-cuda-training-series-september-17-2020/>.
