## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### NERSC Federated Identity Pilot Begins Today! <a name="fedid"/></a> 

Starting today, Berkeley Lab staff can now follow a
one-time process to link their Lab identity to their NERSC identity, then
subsequently use their Lab credentials to log into resources such as Iris,
ServiceNow, and the NERSC web site.

We anticipate that soon, more than two-thirds of our users
will be able to use their institutional login credentials to log into
these NERSC services.

**The appearance of the NERSC login page for these services has now changed**: 
instead of the form requesting your login name and password you will
see a menu where you can choose the institution to use for login.

During this first phase, if you are not Berkeley Lab staff, simply select
"NERSC" as the authentication source, and you will be sent to the
familiar NERSC authentication form. If you are Lab staff, we encourage you 
to select the "Berkeley Lab" option and try it out!

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Recompile Strongly Recommended After Upcoming Maintenance on Perlmutter <a name="pmrecompile"/></a> 

The upcoming maintenance on Perlmutter, scheduled for the week of 12/6, is a
major upgrade. We will be updating the operating system and changing the default
modules to simplify and unify the programming environment as well as updating
the network software. Because of these changes, we recommend that you recompile
your codes after Perlmutter returns from this maintenance. We will post exact
details of the changes and links to any new instructions on Perlmutter's
timeline page (<https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/timeline/>) as the 
date approaches. 


### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive in
early 2022. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken out
of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up to 8 
weeks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Prepare Your Dotfiles for Perlmutter! <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

To help ready your account for Perlmutter, please review your dotfiles. The same
home file system is mounted across all NERSC systems, so your 
`.bashrc`/`.cshrc`/etc. files (dotfiles) need to work on all systems. The
NERSC\_HOST variable can help you distinguish between systems and to set 
customizations for each system. The NERSC\_HOST variable is set automatically to
"perlmutter" on Perlmutter and to "cori" on Cori. 

Some users may have older dot files that are setting the NERSC\_HOST variable 
without first checking to see whether it already has a value, which will cause
problems on Perlmutter. Please ensure that this is not the case in your
dotfiles. Feel free to reach out to [NERSC consulting](https://help.nersc.gov)
with any questions or issues.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### User Information Transmitted to DOE SC <a name="userstats"/></a> 

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (SC), which is the primary 
sponsor of NERSC, requires that a limited set of information relating to your 
user project/experiment be transmitted to SC at the conclusion of the current 
fiscal year. A subset of this information, including your name, institutional 
affiliation(s), and project title(s), will be publicly disseminated as part of 
an SC user facility user projects/experiments database on the SC website, 
<https://science.osti.gov/>, after the conclusion of the fiscal year. For 
proprietary projects, SC requests that the user provide a project title that is 
suitable for public dissemination. 


### New Default Python module at AY transition (Wed Jan 19, 2022) <a name="python"/></a> 

Python users take note: On Jan 19, 2022 at the Allocation Year rollover, NERSC 
will change our default Python and Python3 modules on Cori to 
python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05. Please note that older Python modules will remain 
available, but users must specify the full module name to continue to use them.

Updates in this module include:
- Mamba 0.7.3 (a faster alternative to conda)
- netcdf4 1.5.3
- mpi4py 3.1.1
- authlib 0.15.4 (support for NERSC's [Superfacility API](https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/sfapi/))

Full release notes are available here: <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/reference/release-notes/#anaconda-2021-05-may-13-2021>.

pip users should be aware that pip packages installed via `--user` will be 
installed at `$HOME/.local/cori/3.8-anaconda-2021.05` (defined by 
`$PYTHONUSERBASE`).

This module is available now via `module load python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05`, so 
we encourage you to test it now. If you notice issues or have questions please 
contact us at <https://help.nersc.gov>. NERSC Python users will find a lot of 
helpful information and advice in our Python documentation: <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/nersc-python/>. 

Note that the python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05 module is already the default on
Perlmutter. There are no scheduled Python module changes on Perlmutter.
