### Join IDEAS-ECP for Thursday Panel on How to Make Teams Tick

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for many to transition to 
unplanned remote work, the IDEAS-ECP Productivity project launched the panel 
series *Strategies for Working Remotely*, which explores important topics in 
this area. The next panel discussion in the series is titled "How to Make Teams
Tick", and will be held this Thursday, August 27, from noon to 1:15 PM (Pacific
time).

**Abstract:** Many teams have been working remotely for several months as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, teams were largely co-located 
and comfortable that way -- they just seemed to tick. Now that teams have become
fully virtual and can no longer rely on productivity practices driven by being 
face-to-face, how have they managed change? What personal challenges have they 
faced, and how are they bringing back into balance team dynamics and individual 
well-being? What are they learning about themselves and each other that has been
unexpected? In the fifth installment of this IDEAS-ECP panel discussion series, 
we take a deeper dive and bring together members of successful software teams, 
Sierra and Portage, to speak candidly about being disrupted by change and 
bringing their teams back into balance. Panelists will make brief introductory 
comments followed by open discussion.
