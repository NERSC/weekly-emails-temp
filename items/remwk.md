### (NEW) Join IDEAS-ECP for Thursday Retrospective Panel on Strategies for Working Remotely

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for many to transition to 
unplanned remote work, the IDEAS-ECP Productivity project launched the panel 
series *Strategies for Working Remotely*, which explores important topics in 
this area. The next panel discussion in the series is titled "Strategies for
Working Remotely -- Year in Review", and will be held this Thursday, 
December 17, from noon to 1:00 PM (Pacific time).

**Abstract:** As we bring 2020 to a close, waht have we learned so far about our
