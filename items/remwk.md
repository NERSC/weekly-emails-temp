### (NEW) Join IDEAS-ECP for Thursday Panel on Sustainable Hybrid Work Approaches

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and need for many to transition to 
unplanned remote work, the IDEAS-ECP Productivity project launched the panel 
series *Strategies for Working Remotely*, which explores important topics in 
this area. The next panel discussion in the series is titled "Sustainable
Hybrid Approaches", and will be held this Thursday, October 29, from noon to 
1:15 PM (Pacific time).

**Abstract:** In Spring 2020 many workers abruptly transitioned from a primarily
on-site to a primarily remote work experience. Many people will be (or already 
are) transitioning to a hybrid experience, spending some days on site and some 
remote. Working in this hybrid setting is likely to last longer for many people 
than the primarily remote setting. For some, the hybrid setting may go on 
indefinitely. In this panel discussion, we learn from colleagues who have worked
in a hybrid setting during their careers, as well as some who are new to remote 
work.  We will discuss some of the challenges we have faced in primarily remote 
settings and how these challenges might be addressed in hybrid settings. Themes 
will include making effective use of time on site, best practices and principles
for teams who are blended remote and on site, and how to be effective and 
efficient in long-term hybrid settings.
