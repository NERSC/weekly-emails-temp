### Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources Shortened to July 10-14

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a three-day weekend outage,
is scheduled for July 10-14. An additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled 
for September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

Note that we had originally allocated four days for next week's outage; however,
thanks to some process improvements we were able to reduce the power outage to
only three days.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed From Saturday, July 11 to Monday,
July 13. In preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning 
on Friday, July 10. Power will be restored on or before Tuesday, July 14, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time) on
Friday, July 10, to 11:59 pm on Tuesday, July 14.
