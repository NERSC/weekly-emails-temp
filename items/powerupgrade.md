### UPDATE: October 7-12 Power Upgrade Will Impact Only Cori Auxiliary Nodes

The scope of the power upgrade that will take place October 7-12 has changed,
meaning that there will be a much smaller impact than previously reported.

The circuit that must be taken down does not power the main Cori system, so all
equipment on that circuit that is already connected to the backup generator is
expected to remain powered on for the duration of the work.

However, there are some auxiliary nodes not part of the main Cori system that 
are powered by this circuit and are not connected to the backup generator. The 
**impacted nodes include the JGI ExVivo nodes, the Cori GPU nodes, and the 
recently installed large memory nodes.** These nodes will be taken offline on
October 7, and will return to service after the outage is complete, on
October 12.
