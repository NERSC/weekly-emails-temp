### Planned Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources June 26-29

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a full-weekend outage, is 
scheduled for June 26-29. An additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled for 
September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed over the weekend of June 27-28,
but in preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning on
Friday, June 26. Power will be restored on or before Monday, June 29, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time) on
Friday, June 26, to 6:00 pm on Monday, June 29.
