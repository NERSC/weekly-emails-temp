### Planned Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources in Late June

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a full-weekend outage, is 
being scheduled for late June (the dates are being finalized this week). An
additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled for September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.
