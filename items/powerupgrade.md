### Planned Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources June 25-29

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a three-day weekend outage,
is scheduled for June 26-29. An additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled 
for September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed From Friday, June 26 to Sunday,
June 29. In preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning 
on Thursday, June 25. Power will be restored on or before Monday, June 29, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time) on
Thursday, June 25, to 6:00 pm on Monday, June 29.

This was previously published as a two-day weekend outage, but due to increased
safety requirements, had to be expanded to a three-day outage. We appreciate
your flexibility under these unusual circumstances.
