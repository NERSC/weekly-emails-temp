### Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources October 7-12

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one was held July 10-13. 
**A second outage is now scheduled for October 7-12.**

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first components of which will begin to arrive later in October.

More details will be provided in future communications.
