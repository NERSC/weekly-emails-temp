### Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources on July 9-14

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a four-day weekend outage,
is scheduled for July 9-14. An additional, shorter, outage will be scheduled 
for September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed From Friday, July 10 to Monday,
July 13. In preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning 
on Thursday, July 9. Power will be restored on or before Tuesday, July 14, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time) on
Thursday, July 9, to 11:59 pm on Tuesday, July 14.

This outage was originally scheduled for the last weekend in June, but had to be
pushed out due to ongoing safety requirements. We appreciate your understanding
under these unusual circumstances.
