### Plan for the New Allocation Year, Beginning January 20, 2021

The new NERSC allocation year (AY) begins on January 20, 2021.

Any new and continuing projects received notice in early December. Additional 
information was sent before the holidays to PIs and PI proxies of continuing 
projects on how to update your project's continuing user list and authorize the 
use of premium.

There will be a few changes for AY 2021 centered around access and charging for 
the "premium" QOS. PIs will now be able to authorize only select users to charge
to premium. In addition, high premium utilization (above 20% of a project's
allocation) will be charged a higher premium rate (4x vs 2x the "regular" QOS
cost).

Much will remain the same, however. The base charge rates will not change for
2021, and the software default versions will not change from 2020 defaults. We
anticipate that **software defaults may change later in the year** when we must
perform an upgrade to Cori's operating system.

The Perlmutter machine will come online in AY 2021. Users will not be charged 
for any utilization on Perlmutter in AY 2021. Perlmutter charging will begin in 
AY 2022.
