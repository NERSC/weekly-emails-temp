## Learn to optimize GPU code with Appentra Parallelware on October 17!

Parallelware Trainer helps you to use OpenMP and OpenACC directives to develop 
code for CPUs and GPUs. On Thursday, October 17, Appentra founder Manuel Arneaz
will lead a training session at NERSC focused on optimization of GPU code, 
particularly addressing how to minimize data transfers, how to exploit massive 
parallelism and how to optimize the usage of the GPU memory. The workshop includes
a hands-on session where the participants will apply OpenMP and OpenACC offloading 
directives to their own code or a provided realistic example code.
 
Registration information and agenda for the day are available at:
