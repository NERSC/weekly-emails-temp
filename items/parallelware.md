### Introducing Appentra Parallelware Office Hours Next Wednesday, June 9

[Appentra](https://www.appentra.com) produces the Parallelware tools, aimed at
helping software developers build better quality parallel software in less time.
The [Parallelware Analyzer]()
tool detects and helps to fix defects related to parallelism with OpenMP and
OpenACC, and identifies opportunities for OpenMP/OpenACC parallelization on
CPUs and GPUs.
[Parallelware Trainer]()
is an Integrated Development Environment designed to facilitate the learning,
usage, and implementation of OpenMP/OpenACC parallel programming, along with the
ability to test the performance improvements of particular parallel
implementations.

NERSC has offered trainings on using these tools in
[2019](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-tool-workshop-october-17/)
and
[2020](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-training-series-oct-nov-2020/). 
Now Appentra staff are back at NERSC for virtual office hours, to be held **next
Wednesday, June 9, from 9 am to noon (Pacific time)**. Users who are interested 
in getting started or who have already used the tools but have questions are
invited to drop in at any time during the event. For more information please see
