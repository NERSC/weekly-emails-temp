## Not Too Late to Join Appentra Parallelware Tool Training on June 6!

NERSC is always looking for new ways to improve user experience while coding.
One ever-present challenge in high-performance computing is how to parallelize 
your code to improve on-node or offload performance. Many users struggle with
getting this right. Fortunately, Appentra has developed the 
[Parallelware](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/) Trainer
Tool to teach you!

NERSC has partnered with Appentra to offer a one-day training for users to try 
this new tool. This training, which will be taught by Appentra founder Manuel 
Arneaz, will be offered on Thursday, June 6 at NERSC. It will begin with an 
overview of the tool and how to use it, and continue with a hands-on session for
the remainder of the day.

It is still possible to attend remotely. For more information and to register, 
please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/parallelware-tool-workshop-june-6-2019/>.
