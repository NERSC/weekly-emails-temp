## Limited Consulting and Account Support over the Holidays

During the festive season (which is December 24, 2019 to January 1, 
2020 as observed by Berkeley Lab), Consulting and Account support will be
generally unavailable. On Friday, December 27 and Monday, December 30, there
will be limited Consulting and Account support. The consultant on duty will
answer any urgent queries, but queries of lower priority may not be taken up
until regular service resumes.
