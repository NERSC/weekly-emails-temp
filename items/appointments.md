### New NERSC Appointment Types Now Available!

NERSC provides 25-minute appointments with user support consultants on a range
of topics. We are expanding our offerings to include GPU-related appointments
to help users prepare for the Perlmutter system.

In addition to the already existing NERSC 101, KNL Optimization, Containers,
and File Systems categories, we now offer
- **GPU Basics**, aimed at programming GPUs for users who are new to the topic; 
and
- **Using GPUs in Python**, for advice on using GPUs from Python.

For more information on appointments, please see
