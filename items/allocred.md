## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments on April 10 

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, April 10, we will perform the first quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 10% of its allocation, then
25% of the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve.
