## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments Tomorrow

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

On Tuesday, July 10, we will perform the second quarterly allocation 
adjustments. If a repo has charged less than 10% of its allocation, then
25% of the unused balance will be returned to its DOE office reserve. A repo
that has charged less than 5% of its allocation will have 50% of its allocation
returned to its DOE office reserve.
