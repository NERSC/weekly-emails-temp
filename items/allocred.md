### First Allocation Reductions Begin Next Week

The first allocation reductions will occur **next Tuesday, May 4.**

The allocation reduction process takes unused allocation from projects not using
them and allows DOE program managers to redistribute that time to other 
projects. PIs and PI proxies may request exemptions, at least one week before 
the reduction date. **If you wish to request an exemption, please do so by
tomorrow.**

Additional allocation reductions will occur on September 7, 2021. For more
information, including how much allocation will be removed, please see
