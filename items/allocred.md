### (NEW) Allocation Reductions Schedule Set for 2021

Allocation reductions will recommence this year after a one-year hiatus.
The reduction process takes unused allocation from projects not using them and
allows DOE program managers to redistribute that time to other projects. PIs and
PI proxies may request exemptions, at least one week before the reduction date.

Reduction dates this year will be **May 4 and September 7, 2021.** For more
information, including how much allocation will be removed, please see
