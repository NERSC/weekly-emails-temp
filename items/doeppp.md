## Submissions for 2019 DOE Performance Portability and Productivity Workshop Now Open!

The DOE Performance, Portability and Productivity workshop, which will be held
April 2-4, 2019 in Denver, CO, is an opportunity for researchers to share ideas,
practical experiences, and methodologies for tackling the compelling problems at
the intersection of performance, portability, and productivity. The meeting 
attracts a diverse, cross-disciplinary audience from DOE laboratories and their 
industry and academic partners, bringing together compiler, language, and 
runtime experts; performance engineers; and domain scientists.

Authors are invited to submit novel research from all areas concerned with
performance, portability, and productivity. Previously submitted works or works
in progress are acceptable. Topics of interest include:
- Extensions to standard languages, libraries and runtimes such as C/C++, 
Fortran, OpenMP, OpenACC, SYCL, OpenCL
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- Software tools, libraries, domain specific languages and other abstractions
- Case studies, with both positive and negative experiences, documenting efforts
to run across multiple diverse platforms using state-of-the-art tools and 
techniques
- Achieving performance portability for legacy codes
- Preparing applications for unexpected changes in architecture, e.g., managing 
multiple memory hierarchies
- Definitions of and metrics for measuring performance portability
- Experiences with burst buffers and other I/O approaches
- Productivity concerns related to the above topics

For more information and to submit, please see
