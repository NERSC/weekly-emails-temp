## Globus Sharing Now Available at NERSC

Users can now share their NERSC data using Globus Sharing. This is ideal for 
easily sharing large volumes (i.e. order TBs) of data without requiring you to 
create temporary accounts or transfer your data to an external storage system. 
You can create custom read-only endpoints and control who has access to them. To
set up an endpoint at NERSC, see the instructions here: 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/services/globus/#globus-sharing>.
