NERSC will host a 4-hour VASP hands-on user training online next Tuesday June

the heavily discounted flex QOS.

The training begins with a one-hour presentation from NERSC HPC consultant 
Zhengji Zhao, followed by a 3-hour hands-on session. There will be a Q/A session
after the presentation. Bring your questions about using VASP at NERSC and your
VASP jobs to the hands-on session.
