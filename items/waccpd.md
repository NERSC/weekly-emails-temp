### 8th Workshop on Accelerator Programming using Directives (WACCPD 2021): CFP Closes this Friday!

Exploiting the maximum available parallelism out of accelerated (CPU+GPU)
systems requires refactoring and rewriting applications using a programming
approach that can make effective use of accelerators. The WACCPD workshop aims
to showcase all aspects of accelerator programming for heterogeneous systems
such as innovative high-level language or library approaches, lessons learned
while using directives or other portable approaches to migrate scientific
legacy code to modern systems, and compilation and runtime scheduling 
techniques.

Topics of interest for paper or panel submissions include (but are not limited
to)
- Application developers' experiences porting scientific codes to 
  heterogeneous systems
- Critical assessment of the benefits and limitations of minimal-maintenance
  portable programming approaches
- Compiler and runtime support for current and emerging architectures
- Prototypes of base language parallelism constructs for accelerators
- Design and development of directives created for complex parallel patterns
- Abstract handling of complex/heterogeneous memory hierarchies
- Extensions to and shortcomings of current directives for heterogeneous systems
- Compare and contrast high-level and lower-level abstractions with respect to
  performance, tuning, programmer productivity, and overall analysis
- Modeling, verification, and performance-analysis tools
- Auto-tuning and optimization strategies
- Using non-tradititional HPC languages such as Julia or Python on
  heterogeneous systems
- Parallel computing using hybrid programming paradigms, i.e., MPI+X
- Asynchronous execution and scheduling (task-based approaches)
- Scientific library interoperability with programming approaches for 
  accelerators
- Power/energy studies and solutions targeting accelerators or heterogeneous
  systems.

**this Friday, August 27, 2021**.
