### Hardware Upgrade for Global Homes and Common File Systems Begins Soon

NERSC's storage team is working to upgrade the hardware that provides the Homes 
and Common filesystems. Storage administrators will migrate data on behalf of 
users, resulting in minimal performance impact, and no other disruption during
the migration procedure. The new hardware not only reduces complexity behind the
scenes, but uses only solid state drives (SSDs). These changes should result in 
a slight performance increase after the migration is complete near the end of 
April. User quotas will remain unchanged.
