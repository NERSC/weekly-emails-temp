### OpenACC Training Series Continues Thursday

OpenACC is a directive-based approach to parallel programming for heterogeneous 
architectures, where developers specify regions of code (written in C, C++, 
or Fortran) to be offloaded from a host CPU to a GPU. This approach is meant 
to reduce the amount of programming effort required of developers relative to 
low-level models, such as CUDA. 

NVIDIA will present a 
[3-part OpenACC training series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/openacc-training-series/)
intended to help new and existing GPU programmers learn to use the 
OpenACC API. 

Each part will include a one-hour presentation and example exercises. The 
exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the presentation and 
can be completed during a one-hour hands-on session following each lecture 
(via teleconference) or on your own. **All training sessions will be online 
only.**

The Thursday training covers data management in OpenACC. For more information
