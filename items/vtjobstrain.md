### Register Now for May 21 Online Hands-On Training on Variable-Time Jobs!

NERSC will host a two-hour, online hands-on user training on variable-time jobs
on Thursday, May 21, from 10:00 am to noon (Pacific time). The training begins
with a 30-minute presentation, followed by a 90-minute hands-on session.

Variable-time jobs can greatly improve queue turnaround by automatically 
exploiting opportunities for backfill in Slurm, allowing the job to start sooner
than it would otherwise. Applications need to be capable of checkpoint/restart,
either through application-level checkpointing or via external checkpointing
tools (e.g., DMTCP).
