## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM)

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC18 in Dallas, Texas in mid-November, 2018.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using parallel programming languages;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Algorithmic models enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due **tomorrow, July 31, 2018**. For more information and to submit, please
