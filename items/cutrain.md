### CUDA Debugging Training on September 14

As a continuation of last year's popular 
[CUDA Training Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/),
NVIDIA will present a session on "CUDA Debugging" to NERSC and
OLCF users on September 14, 2021, from 10 am to noon (Pacific time).

Whether your CUDA codes aren't working at all, or aren't giving you the correct
answer, there are techniques to help tackle any debugging issue. First, we'll
review runtime error-checking best practices. We'll cover "sticky" vs. 
"non-sticky" errors and under what situations it is possible to and how to 
recover from CUDA errors. We'll take a look at a tool called compute-sanitizer,
the recommended first debugging tool to try. Finally, we'll cover the use of the
cuda-gdb debugger: how to build debug codes, start the debugger, set 
breakpoints, single-step, watch variables, inspect memory, and switch thread
focus.

Homework will be provided to reinforce the concepts learned in the session.
NERSC will provide access to its Cori-GPU system for current NERSC
users.

Registration is required for remote participation. For more information and to
