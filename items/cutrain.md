### CUDA Multi-Process Service Training Tomorrow!

As a continuation of last year's popular 
[CUDA Training Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/),
NVIDIA will present a session on "CUDA Multi-Process Service" to NERSC and
OLCF users tomorrow, August 17, 2021, from 10 am to noon (Pacific time).

CUDA allows the user to target a GPU with multiple processes, such as using
multiple ranks to target the same GPU. This session will describe how NVIDIA
GPUs work when targeted by multiple processe simultaneously, and present the
CUDA multi-process service (MPS) which helps improve the scheduling efficiency
of this use case. The multi-instance GPU (MIG) feature on the NVIDIA A100 GPU
will also be discussed, and the difference between MPS and MIG (and when you'd
use one or the other) will be explained. Following the presentation will be a
hands-on session where participants can complete example exercises meant to
reinforce the presented concepts and observe their impact on application 
performance. NERSC will provide access to its Cori-GPU system for current NERSC
users.

Registration is required for remote participation. For more information and to
register please see
