### (NEW) October Cori Maintenance Canceled

**The October Cori maintenance has been canceled.** The updates to installed
software that was originally planned for October 21 will move to the next
maintenance, in November.

At that time, NERSC will install some new software and remove some old software.
**Software defaults will remain the same.**

We will install the 20.10 Cray Programming Environment (PE) Software release and
retire the 20.03 PE. In addition, we will also install the new 19.1.2.254 
version of the Intel compiler (which is the release version 2020 update 2).

More information about new software versions available and old versions
that will be removed will be provided next week.
