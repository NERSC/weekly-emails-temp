### Programming Environment Updates During October Maintenance

As part of the October 21 Cori maintenance, NERSC will install some new
software and remove some old software. **Software defaults will remain the
same.**

We will install the 20.09 Cray Programming Environment (PE) Software release and
retire the 20.03 PE. In addition, we will also install the new 19.1.2.254 
version of the Intel compiler (which is the release version 2020 update 2).

For more information about new software versions available and old versions
that will be removed, please see
