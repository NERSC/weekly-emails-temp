## MFA Office Hours: this Monday through Wednesday

The use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access NERSC resources will
become mandatory on Tuesday, January 8, 2019. We encourage users to get a head
start to iron out any wrinkles ahead of time.

NERSC will be holding virtual office hours via Zoom from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm
(Pacific time), to assist users with this transition, on the following dates:
- Monday, January 7, 2019
- Tuesday, January 8, 2019
- Wednesday, January 9, 2019

Please join us at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/752299719> during office hours to get
some help!
