### Intro to Kernel Performance Analysis with NVIDIA Nsight Compute, August 26

As part of the ALCF Developer Sessions, there will be a training on kernel
performance analysis with NVIDIA Nsight Compute on Thursday, August 26, from
9-10:30 am (Pacific). The session is open to NERSC users.

During the session, the use of Nsight Compute for analyzing the performance of
individual kernels on NVIDIA GPUs will be explored. We will walk through some
simple compute kernels which are compute-bound and memory bandwidth-bound and
learn to profile them, generate roofline charts, and analyze their performance.
We'll then introduce a sample realistic kernel from and HPC application and
discuss how comprehensive kernel analysis can be used in an iterative process to
substantially speed up key application bottlenecks. The webinar will conclude
with an interactive demo and time for hands-on with Nsight Compute.
