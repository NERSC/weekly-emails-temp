## Recap: Northern California power outage last week

This fire season, PG&E (the utility that provides power to Berkeley Lab and NERSC)
announced a wildfire prevention plan that would preemptively de-energize power 
lines during high-risk weather conditions. NERSC responded by preparing procedures 
that allow us to respond to a power outage with minimal disruption to our users,
even given potentially short notice and an indefinite duration.

Last Tuesday (October 8) this preparation proved its worth when PG&E announced
a likely power outage beginning just after midnight on Wednesday morning.

Safely cutting and restoring power to complex facilities such as Berkeley Lab and 
NERSC is not a trivial operation. NERSC has a generator that can supply power for
some time to its critical equipment and auxiliary systems, but not to its HPC 
systems. Therefore the Cori compute nodes were shutdown first, but login nodes,
filesystems and the website continued to be available. 

With reduced cooling ability and a warm afternoon, the remaining NERSC systems 
excepting our website were shutdown on Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile PG&E were 
inspecting power lines and in the evening, restored power to the Lab's substation.

Power was restored to NERSC around 10:30 am on Friday, and NERSC staff spent the 
day bringing the many systems that support our HPC facilities back to service. 
By midnight, Cori and most other NERSC services were opened to users, with the 
remaining services returned to service shortly later. Berkeley Lab re-opened
at 6 am this (Monday) morning, and Consulting and Account Support Services resumed
today.

We hope that this will be the only event of its kind, but as long as there is 
a risk of wildfires, there is a chance that our power will again be cut. We plan 
to keep our users well-informed of events if this should happen again, and 
<http://status.lbl.gov/> will continue to indicate the status of Berkeley Lab as 
a whole.

We'd like to thank you all again for your patience and support during this 
unprecedented event!
