## Recap: Northern California power outage October 26

The California wildfire season continues and only two weeks after the conclusion 
of the first PG&E Public Safety Power Shutdown (PSPS), a second PSPS affecting 
NERSC was announced on Friday October 25. On Saturday morning the expected start 
was moved forward, and in response NERSC began shutdown procedures around 1:30pm.

At about 2pm on Saturday October 26, Cori and the NERSC filesystems became 
unavailable to users. Our generator is able to supply power for web services, 
databases and other auxiliary services, and fortunately we were able to keep these
running for the duration of the PSPS.

On Monday evening PG&E announced that power to Berkeley Lab's substation was 
restored, and work began to return power to the Lab, including NERSC. NERSC 
power was restored late on Monday night, and early on Tuesday work began to restore
NERSC systems to service. NERSC was back to full service a little before 7pm PDT on
Tuesday October 29.

Some scheduled maintenance and some user-training events were delayed or modified
as a consequence of the outage, we apologize for the inconvenience to our users.

We would like to thank our users for your patience and support again during this 
second outage. We hope that this will be the last such outage, but should another 
PSPS occur we plan to keep our users well-informed of events. <http://status.lbl.gov/>
will also continue to indicate the status of Berkeley Lab.
