## Cori Maintenance Tomorrow

The operating system on both Cori and Edison will be upgraded this month. We 
will work on Cori during the quarterly maintenance tomorrow, and on Edison 
during the monthly Edison maintenance time period at the end of the month. The 
upgrade is expected to take 36 hours for each machine. **Cori will be 
unavailable to users from 7:00 am tomorrow until 7:00 pm Wednesday.**

At 7:00 am Pacific tomorrow, all users will be logged off of Cori's login nodes.
A reservation will be in place that prevents user jobs from running after that 
time, but in the unlikely event a user job is running, it will be terminated. At
that time the machine will be updated with the new operating system and all 
nodes will be rebooted. This is a complicated process that often requires 
multiple iterations. While it is possible that the systems could be returned to 
service earlier than 7:00 pm on Wednesday, users should plan on a 36-hour 
outage.

On May 23, the same OS upgrade process will be performed on Edison, with it 
returning to service by the end of the day on May 24.
