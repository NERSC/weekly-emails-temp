## NERSC User Survey for AY 2019 Continues

Users who were active in 2019 were sent personalized invitations for the 
annual NERSC User Survey from a company called NBRI this past Wednesday. 
Thank you to the 300 users who have already submitted your feedback.

The survey helps NERSC judge the quality of our services and identify 
areas we could improve, and is important for our annual reporting to DOE, 
so please take some time to complete the survey before it closes.
