### Don't Forget -- Let NERSC Know How We're Doing via the NERSC User Survey!

NERSC has once again retained an external company, National Business Research 
Institute, to perform our Allocation Year 2020 survey. A personalized invitation
to take the survey was emailed to each user on Thursday, November 19, and a
reminder was sent this morning.

Please take the survey to let NERSC know how we're doing, and what we can do
better to serve you.
