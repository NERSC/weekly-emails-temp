### NERSC User Survey for AY 2019 Closes this Friday, February 28th

Users who were active in 2019 were sent personalized invitations for the 
annual NERSC User Survey from a company called NBRI. Thank you to the 500
users who have already submitted your feedback.

The survey helps NERSC judge the quality of our services and identify 
areas we could improve, and is important for our annual reporting to DOE.
If you haven't already, **please use the link in your email to complete
the survey before Friday, Feb 28th**.
