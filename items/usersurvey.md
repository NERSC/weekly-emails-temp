### (NEW) Annual User Survey Begins Tomorrow!

NERSC has engaged a professional survey company, the National Business Research
Institute (NBRI), to conduct our annual user survey. Users can **expect an email
from <NERSC@nbriresearch.com> in their inboxes tomorrow**, with a personalized
link to the user survey.

We value your response to the survey, which helps inform future plans for
improvements to benefit our users. Please take the survey to let us know what 
we've done well and how we can better serve you!
