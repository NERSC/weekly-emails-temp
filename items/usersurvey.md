### Spend the Downtime Letting NERSC Know How We're Doing via the NERSC User Survey!

NERSC has once again retained an external company, National Business Research 
Institute, to perform our Allocation Year 2020 survey. A personalized invitation
to take the survey was emailed to each user on Thursday, November 19, and 
reminders have been sent weekly.

If you haven't yet taken the survey, there's still time! This week, consider 
spending some of the time you would normally spend on your science at NERSC 
evaluating NERSC instead!

We welcome your feedback on how we're doing, and what we can do better to serve 
you.
