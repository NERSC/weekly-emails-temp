### NERSC User Survey for AY 2019 Extended until Wednesday March 4

Users who were active in 2019 were sent personalized invitations for the 
annual NERSC User Survey from a company called NBRI. Thank you to the 650
users who have already submitted your feedback.

**The survey will remain open for another 2 days, until Wednesday March 4th**. 
Filling out the survey helps NERSC judge the quality of our services and 
identify areas we could improve, and is important for our annual reporting to 
DOE. If you haven't already, **please use the link in your email to complete
the survey before Wednesday**.
