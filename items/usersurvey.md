### Please participate in the NERSC Annual User Survey

NERSC has engaged a professional survey company, the National Business Research
Institute (NBRI), to conduct our annual user survey. Users can search for  
**a reminder email from <NERSC@nbriresearch.com> in their inboxes** 
with a personalized link to the user survey. The latest reminder was sent last
week to those who have not yet completed the survey.

We value your response to the survey, which helps inform future plans for
improvements to benefit our users. Please take the survey to let us know what 
we've done well and how we can better serve you!
