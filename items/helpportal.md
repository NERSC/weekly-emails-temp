### Try Out the New NERSC Help Portal!

NERSC has launched a new help portal, featuring a redesigned "open ticket" form
and quick access to other types of requests. Available at 
<https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp>, the new portal also includes
- Search: view requests and tickets visible to you from the past year;
- Recent tickets: lists all your tickets from the last 3 months;
- Project tickets: lists open tickets shared with at least one of your NERSC 
projects;
- Watchlist: lists open tickets for which you are on the watchlist.

After a period of testing, this new interface will become the default for 
<https://help.nersc.gov> (but the "classic view" will continue to remain
available).
