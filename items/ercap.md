### (NEW) 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Opens September 7

The ERCAP allocations process will begin accepting requests for the 2022 
Allocation Year (AY) on Tuesday, September 7. To be considered for an allocation
that will start on the first day of the 2022 AY, please submit your request
before the end of the day on Monday, October 4.

There are a few changes in store for the 2022 Allocation Year. Highlights 
include
- Re-valuation from the NERSC-hour based on the performance of the Hopper 
machine, to a new Node-hour scheme based on Perlmutter's performance;
- Separate allocation of CPU-only and GPU hours;
- Inclusion of requests for GPU hours and justification regarding GPU readiness;
- Minor improvements to the form.

More details on these differences, along with strategies for writing the best 
request and opportunities for advice from NERSC staff, will be provided in 
future communications.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
ERCAP process.
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen
