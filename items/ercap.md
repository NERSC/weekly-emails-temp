## 2019 ERCAP Call for Proposals Now Open

The 2019 ERCAP Proposal season is now open! NERSC has updated and improved the 
ERCAP request form based on extensive user feedback. 

All current projects (including startup, education, and Director's Reserve 
projects) must be renewed for 2019 if you wish to continue using NERSC in the
new allocation year. New project requests may be submitted as well (to start in
2019).

For consideration of your request before the new allocation year begins, please 
apply at <https://ercap.nersc.gov> before 11:59 PM Pacific Time October 15.
