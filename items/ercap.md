### (UPDATE) 2022 ERCAP Allocations Process Due Date Extended to Friday!

The ERCAP allocations process began accepting requests for the 2022 
Allocation Year (AY) on Tuesday, September 7. To be considered for an allocation
that will start on the first day of the 2022 AY, please submit your request
**before 5:00 pm (Pacific time) on Friday, October 8!**

There are a few changes in store for the 2022 Allocation Year. Highlights 
include
- Re-valuation from the NERSC-hour based on the performance of the Hopper 
machine, to a new Node-hour scheme based on Perlmutter's performance;
- Separate allocation of CPU-only and GPU hours;
- Inclusion of requests for GPU hours and justification regarding GPU readiness;
- Minor improvements to the form.

We would like to draw your attention to the fact that **there is a new unit of 
currency (normalized to the Perlmutter CPU node hour) for the new allocation 
year.** A simple way to convert is to simply divide this year's usage by 400. 
If you requested one million NERSC hours this year (AY2021), this translates to 
2,500 node hours next year. Therefore we expect most CPU requests would not 
exceed 20,000 node hours, and our largest requestors might ask for 250,000 node 
hours. GPU node hour requests should be similarly small.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
ERCAP process.
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen
