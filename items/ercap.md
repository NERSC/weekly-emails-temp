### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Is Open!

The ERCAP allocations process has now begun accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY). Requests will be accepted through Monday, October 5, 2020.

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen 
to [this podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l). 

Allocations staff will once again hold virtual office hours via Zoom to assist
users with finishing up and submitting their ERCAP requests, on the following
dates:
- Thursday, August 27
- Thursday, September 4
- Thursday, September 17
- Thursday, October 1
- Monday, October 5 (ERCAP due date)

We will provide more details, including times and connection info, as we get 
closer to the date.
