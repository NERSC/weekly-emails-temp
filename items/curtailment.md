### Normal NERSC Operations Expected During California Shelter-in-Place Period

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in California, which is under a 
statewide public health shelter-in-place Order for an indefinite period of time.
Under this Order, only essential businesses may remain open. NERSC is considered
an essential business due to its national importance, so we are staying in 
operation, but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a 
skeleton crew onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. All trainings will be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing will be so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.
