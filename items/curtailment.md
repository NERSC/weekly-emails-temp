### Normal NERSC Operations Expected During Bay Area Shelter-in-Place Period

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in the six-county San Francisco
Bay area which is under a public health shelter-in-place Order for 14 days
beginning tomorrow. Under this Order, only essential businesses may remain open.
NERSC is considered an essential business due to its national importance, so we 
will stay in operation, but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely 
and only a skeleton crew onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. All trainings will be held online, or postponed if 
online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will continue to be 
performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could result in longer 
downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing will be so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.
