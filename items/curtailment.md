### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.
