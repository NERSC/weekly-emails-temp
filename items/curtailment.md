### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes

Alameda County, California, where NERSC is located, remains under public health 
order restrictions. Upon the reopening of the California economy tomorrow, we do
not anticipate substantial changes to our operations, as we continue to balance 
local, state, and Department of Energy safety requirements.

NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific protection plans.
We remain in operation as before, with the majority of NERSC staff working
remotely for the foreseeable future, and only staff essential to operations 
onsite.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.
