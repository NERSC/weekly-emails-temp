### NERSC Operations Continue as Berkeley Lab Reopens, with Minimal Changes

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is beginning to welcome employees back
on-site following a two-year absence. NERSC remains in operation, with the 
majority of NERSC staff continuing to work remotely, and staff essential to 
operations onsite. We do not expect any disruptions to our operations in the 
next few months as the site reopens.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing remains minimal, we request that you continue to refrain
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.
