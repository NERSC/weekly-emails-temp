### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During Shelter-in-Place Period

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in a city and county in 
California that remain under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order. Under this 
Order, only essential businesses may remain open. NERSC is considered an 
essential business due to its national importance, so we remain in operation,
but with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can expect regular online consulting and account support
but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held online, or 
postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the systems will 
continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, which could 
result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.
