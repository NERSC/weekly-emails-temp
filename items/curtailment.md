### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.
