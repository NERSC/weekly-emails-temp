## New Time for Weekly Email ##

Since its inception, the NERSC weekly email has gone out to users on Mondays at
8:00 am Pacific Time. However, there have been times when this early morning
deadline has meant that important decisions did not get conveyed to users until 
a week later. To better serve the needs of NERSC users, we have now moved the
time for sending the weekly email to 2:00 pm Pacific Time.
