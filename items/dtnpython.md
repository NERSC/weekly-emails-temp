### Default Python on DTNs Changing to Python 3 on October 12

NERSC will change the default Python module on the Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)
to Python 3 next Monday, October 12. Python 2 will remain but will no longer be the 
default. Note that the minimal set of libraries provided in the DTN Python 3 
module were selected to assist with data movement rather than provide a full
suite of applications as on Cori.
