## Call for Proposals: High-Impact Science at Scale on Cori <a name="his"/> ##

NERSC is seeking proposals to conduct high-impact science campaigns using NERSC Cori 
supercomputer at scale.  Up to 600 million NERSC Hours in total for allocation year 2018 
will be awarded to research teams addressing scientific problems that require the 
computing capability provided by Cori's Xeon Phi "Knight's Landing" (KNL) nodes. A 
successful proposal would require the use of at least 2,000 KNL nodes to solve a problem, 
with a preference for proposals that exploit Cori's unique capabilities (e.g., using all 
or most of the 9,688 KNL nodes or making heavy use of the burst buffer). Previous awards 
were in the range of 10-100M NERSC hours. Data-intensive projects requiring large-scale 
analytics (statistics, machine learning, deep learning) are encouraged to apply.
