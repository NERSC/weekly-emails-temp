## Register Today for Petascale Computing Institute, August 19-23, 2019

NERSC is co-hosting the [2019 Petascale Computing 
Institute](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/petascale-computing-2019) 
training in collaboration with ALCF, NCSA, OLCF, Pittsburgh Supercomputing 
Center, SciNet at U Toronto, and TACC.

Content is targeted to individuals conducting research and scholarship in all
disciplines, including graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, faculty,
researchers, scholars, educators, and practitioners in academia, industry, and
government agencies. The institute will benefit primarily research teams
preparing to scale their codes to petascale-class resources, people working on
parallel codes, and those needing to scale up computational and/or data analysis
codes.

Participants can attend in person at one of the host sites across the United 
States, Canada, Costa Rica, or Brazil, or may tune in live on YouTube. NERSC is
one of the host sites; check for a site in your area when signing up to
participate.
