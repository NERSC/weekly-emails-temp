### (NEW) NERSC Public Events and Outages Google Calendars Available!

NERSC has two publicly viewable calendars aimed at users, the NERSC Public 
Events Calendar and the NERSC Outages Calendar, to help users keep track of

The **NERSC Public Events** calendar shows events such as trainings, and NUG 
webinars. It is viewable as a standalone calendar at
