## NERSC Outages Google Calendar Available!

Do you wish there were a way to coordinate your work with the NERSC maintenance
schedule? Do you read the weekly email but forget when the next NERSC 
maintenance is? 

NERSC has a calendar, "NERSC Outages", that is publicly available to view. You
can see it in MyNERSC at <https://my.nersc.gov/outagecal-cs.php>, or as a
standalone calendar at 
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles>,
and you can also add it to your own calendar:
- The Google calendar ID is 
<lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8@group.calendar.google.com>
- For iCal users, the link is
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/lbl.gov_hgvrbjd08kf6srjjtt1ifh0qi8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics>

The calendar is automatically populated by the NERSC Message of the Day (MOTD),
and also includes historical information about when systems were unavailable or
in degraded mode in addition to future scheduled outages.
