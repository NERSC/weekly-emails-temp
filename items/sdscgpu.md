### GPU Hackathon at SDSC, May 11-15

The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), in conjunction with NVIDIA, NERSC,
and OLCF, will be hosting a GPU Hackathon from May 11-15, 2020 as part of our
annual [GPU Hackathon Series](https://hpc-training.sdsc.edu/gpuhackathon/). 
These hackathons are 5-day coding events in which
teams of developers prepare their own application(s) to run on GPUs or focus on
optimizing their application(s) that currently run on GPUs. Teams should consist
of three or more developers who are intimately familiar with (some part of)
their application, and they will work alongside two mentors with GPU programming
expertise. If you want/need to get your code running (or optimized) on a
GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer a unique opportunity to set aside
5 days, surround yourself with experts in the field, and push toward your
development goals. During the event, teams will have access to compute resources
provided by SDSC, NERSC, and OLCF.

If you are interested in more information, or would like to submit a short
proposal form, please visit SDSC's event page:
<https://hpc-training.sdsc.edu/gpuhackathon/>. Please note the **deadline to submit
a proposal is March 11, 2020**. 

For questions about the hackathon please contact Tom Papatheodore (`papatheodore` at
`ornl.gov`) or Susan Rathbun (`susan` at `sdsc.edu`).
