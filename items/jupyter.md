## Update on Jupyter and Jupyter-dev Upgrades 

On Tuesday August 14, both jupyter.nersc.gov and jupyter-dev.nersc.gov services 
were upgraded. The JupyterLab interface is now the default for both hubs.  
During the upgrade some packages and extensions may have been dropped but can 
be restored upon request.  If functionality has been lost or needs attention 
please don't hesitate to contact us at <https://help.nersc.gov>.
