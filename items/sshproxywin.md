## SSH Proxy Now Available for Windows PuTTY Users

The convenient SSH proxy client NERSC originally rolled out for Linux/Unix
based systems is now available for Windows users. With this client, you can
use MFA to obtain a PuTTY Private Key (PPK) file that you can use with PuTTY or
load into PuTTY's ssh authentication agent, Pageant. This PPK file will allow
you to use PuTTY to connect to NERSC hosts without further authentication
during the key's lifetime (24 hours by default). For more information, including
where to download the client, please take a look at the documentation:
