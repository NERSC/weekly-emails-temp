## Women in HPC Workshop at SC18 Call for Submissions Deadline Extended to this Wednesday 

The Women in HPC Workshop at SC18 seeks submissions in the form of extended
abstracts for short talks to be given during the workshop.  The workshop, which 
will be held in conjunction with SC18 in Dallas, Texas in November, is an 
opportunity for participants to grow their network, receive expert advice and
mentorship from accomplished colleagues, and meet potential employers.
Submissions from early-career women are especially encouraged, although authors 
may submit irrespective of career stage. 

Submissions close this Wednesday, August 15. For more information, including 
how to submit, please see <https://womeninhpc.org/whpc-sc18/workshop/submit/>.
