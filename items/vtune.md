### VTune Profiler Default Upgraded to 2020 & All Older Versions Deprecated

Last month, the Intel VTune profiler version default was upgraded to 
version 2020. Version 2020 includes significant upgrades in functionality and 
performance, and changes the names of the executables to simpler and 
easier-to-understand strings.

While the older versions (2018.up3 and 2019.up3) remain on Cori, we
encourage you to upgrade your workflow to `vtune/2020`. The deprecated versions
will no longer collect performance data, but can continue to be used to read
and analyze existing performance data that was collected with these tools.
