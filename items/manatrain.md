### Learn to Use MANA Transparent Checkpointing Tool this Friday

NERSC will host an online, hands-on user training on 
[MANA](https://github.com/mpickpt/mana),
a transparent checkpointing tool, this Friday, May 7, 2021 from 10-11:30 am
(Pacific). MANA is an MPI-Agnostic, Network-Agnostic transparent checkpointing
tool, **requiring no modifications to user codes.** Benefits of using MANA
include the capability of running a job of any length on Cori with
checkpoint/restart, the potential for improved job throughput, and the ability
to realize a 75% charging discount by running in the Flex queue.

The training will begin with a 30-minute presentation, followed by a one-hour
hands-on session. For more information and to register, please see
