We will hold a one-day training event for new users on Wednesday, March 21, 2017 
to provide users new to NERSC with the basics for using NERSC systems. Topics 
include accounts and allocations, programming environment, tools, best practices
and the data-intensive science ecosystem. 

The event will be held at LBL's Shyh Wang Hall (Building 59, CRT) in Room 4102. 
All sessions will presented online using Zoom but we highly recommend attending 
in-person if you can.
