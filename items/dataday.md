## Join Us for NERSC Data Day, September 6-7, 2018!

The third annual NERSC Data Day will be held September 6-7, 2018, in combination
with the [LBNL Machine Learning for Science Workshop](#ml4sci). 

The first day will feature an overview of the data analytics and 
machine-learning software stacks at NERSC, with a focus on Python, Jupyter, and
Deep Learning frameworks (Tensor Flow and PyTorch). It will include demos and
hands-on sessions that cover a variety of topics, from best practices for 
efficient utilization of Cori's unique architecture to scaling neural networks
training to multiple nodes.

The second day will cover best practices for data management and transfer at
NERSC in addition to the HPC container technology, Shifter, and our new
edge-services platform, Spin. Join in person or remotely -- it will be a lot
of fun, we promise!
