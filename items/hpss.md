### Test out NERSC's New, Filesystem-Like HPSS Interface!

We've deployed an experimental interface for HPSS called GHI, which offers a 
more familiar file system interface for HPSS. You can use GHI to archive entire 
directory trees or large files without having to worry about bundling files with
htar; the system automatically moves files to a special instance of the HPSS 
archive dedicated to GHI in the optimal tape-friendly configuration for you. 

Documentation for GHI is available at
<https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/filesystems/ghi/>

This is still an experimental system, so don't put in any unique data. If you 
are interested in trying it out, please [open a ticket](https://help.nersc.gov) 
and we'll give you access.
