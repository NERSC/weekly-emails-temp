### Crash Course in Supercomputing, June 11

NERSC invites those with an interest in or just beginning to write parallel
programs to join our one-day Crash Course in Supercomputing on June 11. The
course will be held from 10 am to noon and 1-3 pm (Pacific time).

In this two-part course, students will learn to write parallel programs that
can be run on a supercomputer. We begin by discussing the concepts of 
parallelization before introducing MPI and OpenMP, the two leading parallel 
programming libraries. Finally, the students will put together all the concepts 
from the class by programming, compiling, and running a parallel code on one of 
the NERSC supercomputers. Training accounts will be provided for students who 
have not yet set up a NERSC account.
