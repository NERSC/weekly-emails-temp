### ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge (ALCC) Pre-proposals due Friday!

The Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research's ASCR Leadership Computing
Challenge (ALCC) is an allocation program for projects of interest to the
Department of Energy (DOE), with an emphasis on high-risk, high-payoff
scientific campaigns enabled via high-performance computing (HPC) in areas
directly related to the DOE mission, that respond to national emergencies, or
that broaden the community of researchers capable of using leadership computing
resources.

ASCR is currently soliciting proposals for ALCC allocation awards for the
2022-2023 program year. ASCR HPC platforms available for the allocation cycle
include Summit, the 200-petaflop IBM AC922 system at OLCF; Theta, the
12-petaflop Cray XC40 machine, and Polaris, a new 44-petaflop accelerated system
at ALCF; and Perlmutter, a new accelerated system at NERSC. Up to thirty percent
of the allocatable computing time on each of these machines will be made
available to ALCC users. In addition, limited access may be given to the
exascale Frontier system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, pending the pace of
system acceptance, for nationally important, and exascale-ready projects.

**Submissions are due this Friday, December 17**.
