## New Requirement for ALCC Proposals

For the 2020-2021 ALCC campaign, PIs are **required** to submit a Letter of 
Intent (LOI) as the first step of submitting a proposal. The ALCC submission 
site (<https://science.osti.gov/ascr/ALCC>) opened October 1,
with LOIs due on December 16. 

All proposals are due when the submission site closes at 11:59 PM (Eastern Time)
on February 3, 2020. Information from the LOI will be automatically populated to
the proposal by December 18. Details about submission requirements can be found
