### NERSC Software Support Policy

Supporting the wide range of scientific software needed by a community 
as large and diverse and NERSC users is a challenging task. In AY2020
NERSC is working n implementation of a new 
[Software Support Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/),
whose intent is to allow us to focus softwar esupport efforts where they will 
have the most impact. You can read more about the new policy at
