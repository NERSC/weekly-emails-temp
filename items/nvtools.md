### NVIDIA Performance Tools for A100 GPU Systems Training on February 23

As part of the ALCF Developer Sessions, there will be a training next Wednesday,
February 23 on NVIDIA Performance Tools for A100 GPU Systems. NVIDIA Developer 
Tools are available for detailed performance analysis of HPC applications 
running on DVIDIA DGX A100 systems, such as Perlmutter and ALCF's ThetaGPU 
systems. Learn to use Nsight Systems for a system-wide visualization of an 
application's performance. Use Nsight Compute for interactive kernel profiling. 
In this session, several use cases of Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute will be
presented via a demo with simple HPC benchmarks on ThetaGPU.
