## New MATLAB and Mathematica on Cori

To resolve issues with the transition to the new operating system 
on Cori, we've installed new versions of MATLAB and Mathematica. 
In addition to improved compatibility, the new installations also make new 
functionality available. 

Recent updates to MATLAB have emphasized 
capabilities for deep learning and manipulation of large datasets. The 
latest version of Mathematica brings expanded functionality in 
mathematics, geographic visualization, audio and image processing, and 
machine learning. MATLAB users can now run release R2019a in addition to 
the default R2016a. If no problems arise, the R2019a version will become 
the default after the next Cori maintenance (September 10-12). Users of 
the MATLAB Runtime should note that the R2016a runtime module name has 
changed to MCR_R2016a, and that the runtime for R2019a can be invoked by 
loading the new MCR_R2019a module. 

As for Mathematica, versions 11.3.0 and 12.0.0 are now available, with 11.3.0 
as default.  Version 12.0.0 will become the default after the next Cori 
maintenance if no critical problems arise.
