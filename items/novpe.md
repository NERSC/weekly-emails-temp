### New PE Installations for November Maintenance

During the November Cori maintenance, NERSC will install some new software and 
remove some old software. **Software defaults will remain the same.**

We will install the 20.10 Cray Programming Environment (PE) Software release and
retire the 20.03 PE. In addition, we will also install the new 19.1.2.254 
version of the Intel compiler (which is the release version 2020 update 2).

For more information about specific software versions being added and removed,
please see <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2020Nov/>.
