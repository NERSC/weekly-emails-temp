### (NEW) HPSS Archive Maintenance April 11-16; All Data in Archive Unavailable for Duration!

**Archive, the NERSC HPSS Tape Storage System, will be unavailable for a 
software upgrade from 7 am (Pacific) on April 11, 2021 to 7 pm on 
April 16, 2021.** Although Archive has been running stably without a system 
upgrade for nearly a decade, we must perform this upgrade to take advantage of 
more recent developments in HPSS software. Included in the process is an upgrade
of the metadata for the more than 245 million objects in the Archive, which we 
anticipate will take the bulk of the maintenance period.

**During this maintenance period users will not have any access to the Archive 
or its data, and will not be able to log into Archive** (e.g., via `hsi` or 
`htar` to archive data, via the NERSC HPSS Globus endpoint, or via ftp), so 
please plan accordingly. Once the upgrade is complete, you will be able to 
access your data as usual from any NERSC system without taking any further 
action.

Thank you for your patience during this long-overdue upgrade process. Please 
open a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov> if you have any questions or if you 
need help finding temporary storage space while Archive is unavailable.
