### HPSS Archive Maintenance April 11-16; All Data in Archive Unavailable for Duration!

Archive, the NERSC HPSS Tape Storage System, is currently unavailable for a 
software upgrade that started yesterday at 7 am (Pacific) and is expected to
last until 7 pm on April 16, 2021. 

Users have no access to Archive while it is under maintenance. This means users
cannot archive or retrive data until the upgrade is complete. Once the
maintenance is over, users will once again be able to access all files on
Archive as before. No user files will be deleted during the upgrade process.

Thank you for your patience during this long-overdue upgrade process. Please 
open a ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov> if you have any questions or if you 
need help finding temporary storage space while Archive is unavailable.
