### Join or Nominate a Colleague for the NUG Executive Committee - Deadline Extended to Today!

The NUG Executive Committee (NUGEX) is a group of NERSC users who 
oversee NUG activities for the benefit of NERSC's user community.

Committee members serve for 2-3 years, with up to half of the 
committee being replaced each year. We're looking for new 
committee members who, between them, are representative of the
diverse range of NERSC users - early career and senior researchers,
users who run jobs, project members who analyse data and PIs who 
manage project teams.

NUGEX will meet once per month, for up to 1 hour, for activities 
including:
 - Helping identify HPC needs from NERSC users & scientific communities
 - Helping identify training needs for NERSC users
 - Providing topics or activities related to the NUG annual meeting
 - Coordinating activities at meetings and conferences where NERSC 
   users and/or NERSC staff contributions would be valuable
 - Receiving updates from NERSC on important topics

We are currently seeking volunteers and nominations for NUGEX -- if 
you would like to participate, or to nominate a potential NUGEX member, please

today.
