### New Look to NERSC Online Help Desk; Additional Upgrade During Sitewide Outage

The NERSC online helpdesk (<https://help.nersc.gov/>) now has a new look and
feel based on the NERSC color palette and an update to a new version. (Don't see
it yet? Log out and log back in.)

We will again upgrade the online help desk in conjunction with the sitewide 
power outage. You can expect a 3-hour outage on the Friday morning of the
outage (currently planned for Friday, June 26, from 9 am to noon Pacific time).
