### New Look to NERSC Online Help Desk; Additional Upgrade on June 25

The NERSC online helpdesk (<https://help.nersc.gov/>) now has a new look and
feel based on the NERSC color palette and an update to a new version. (Don't see
it yet? Log out and log back in.)

We will again upgrade the online help desk on Thursday, June 25 from 8 am
to noon (Pacific time). Users will have intermittent access and may not be able
to submit tickets or see any ticket updates during that time.
