### CUDA Training Series Continues Tomorrow, August 18

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The eighth training in the series, to be held tomorrow, August 18, covers 
GPU performance analysis. This module introduces the analysis-driven 
optimization workflow using NVIDIA developer tools Nsight Systems and Nsight
Compute to profile your code and determine what optimizations to make.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
