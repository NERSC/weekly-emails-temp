### CUDA Training Series Continues May 13

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **This event will be held 
exclusively online.**

The fifth training in the series covers CUDA atomics, reductions, and warp 
shuffle. These operations can help you in cases where exposing parallelism is
not immediately obvious due to potential thread contention.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.

Registration for part 5 closes Wednesday, May 6. For more information (including
registration information) please see
