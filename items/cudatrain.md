### CUDA Training Series Continues Next Thursday

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The sixth training in the series covers CUDA managed memory. The system can
automatically migrate data between the host and device as necessary. Learn how
to allocate managed memory, as well as how to use it to store data structures
that might otherwise be difficult to manage manually in a heterogeneous system.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
