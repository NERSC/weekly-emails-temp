## CUDA Training Series Begins Wednesday

NVIDIA will present a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture (for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote 
participants).  OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each 
part of the series.

The first training in the series will take place this Wednesday, January 15, 
2020, from 10 am to 12 pm (Pacific time). This training will introduce 
participants to CUDA C++, an extension of C++ that allows developers to program 
GPUs with a familiar programming language and simple APIs. Participants will 
learn basic concepts, syntax, and APIs needed to transfer data to and from GPUs,
write GPU kernels, and manage GPU thread groups. Following the presentation will
be a hands-on session where in-person participants can complete example 
exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
