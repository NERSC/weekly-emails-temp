### CUDA Training Series Continues March 18

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture (for in-person participants) or on your own (for remote 
participants). OLCF and NERSC will both be holding in-person events for each 
part of the series.

The third training in the series, on Fundamental CUDA Optimization, will 
introduce users to optimization strategies related to kernel launch configurations, 
GPU latency hiding, global memory throughput, and shared memory applicability.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where in-person 
participants can complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented 
concepts.

Registration for part 3 **closes on March 11**. For more information
