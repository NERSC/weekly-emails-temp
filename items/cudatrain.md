### CUDA Training Series Continues July 21

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The seventh training in the series, to be held on Tuesday, July 21, covers 
CUDA concurrency. Concurrency refers to the ability to perform multiple CUDA 
operations simultaneously. Learn about CUDA streams and asynchronous functions 
that can be used to do things like run multiple kernels on a single GPU or 
overlap data transfer and computation.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
