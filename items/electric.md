## REMINDER: Major Maintenance Outage this Friday through Tuesday!

As we have reminded you over the past several weeks, there is a major 
maintenance commencing on Friday that will disrupt all NERSC services for 
several days. The Quarterly Maintenance outage for August has been combined 
with a triennial electrical maintenance. Consequently **NERSC services will be 
disrupted from this Friday, August 17 to Tuesday, August 21** and **no services 
will be available at all on Saturday and Sunday, August 18 and 19**.

Before the maintenance [all DataWarp Persistent Reservations will be 
removed](#dwreformat). After the maintenance existing applications are expected 
to work as before but [we recommend re-linking applications to get the updated 
system libraries](#coriosupdate).

We expect that Edison will return to users on Monday, August 20, and Cori will
return on Tuesday, August 20. However, users should still plan for maintenance
to last the entire scheduled period.

For more information about the electrical maintenance, please listen to the 
interview with NERSC Deputy for Operations Jeff Broughton from the NERSC News 
podcast:
