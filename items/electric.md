## Combined Electrical Facilities Maintenance and Quarterly Machine Maintenance, August 17-21

Every three years, there is a required maintenance on the medium voltage 
switchgear in the NERSC machine room. This ensures the safety of the building,
the supercomputers, and (most importantly) NERSC and Berkeley Lab staff.

It has been three years since NERSC's new facilities at Berkeley Lab were
completed, so it is now time for this maintenance. We have worked with Lab
facilities staff to schedule this maintenance, which will take place the
weekend of August 18-19 while the majority of staff are offsite. For more
information about the electrical maintenance, please listen to the interview
with NERSC Deputy for Operations Jeff Broughton from the NERSC News podcast:
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/August-Electrical-Maintenance-and-Jeff-Broughton-Interview-e1lv6d>.

Because August is also the month for a quarterly machine maintenance, we will
schedule our quarterly maintenance to bookend this outage, in order to
minimize the amount of time that users cannot access NERSC. Therefore we will
begin bringing machines down on Friday, August 17, and continue with machine
maintenance on Monday and Tuesday, August 20 and 21, after facility power has
returned.

In summary, **during the period from Friday, August 17 to Tuesday, August 21,
NERSC services will be disrupted.** On Friday the 17th and Monday and Tuesday,
the 20th and 21st, some services may be available some of the time, and **no
services will be available Saturday and Sunday, August 18 and 19.**
