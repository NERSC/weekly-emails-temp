### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive 
early this year. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken
out of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up 
to 8 weeks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
