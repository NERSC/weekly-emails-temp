### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
