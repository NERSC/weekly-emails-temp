### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running benchmarks successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

Last week we began the process of integrating the community and home file 
systems into the machine. NERSC staff are beginning to set up the software 
environment. Some test jobs with real user applications are being run. 
Preliminary 
[Perlmutter Documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) 
is under development. 

In the [Top500 list](https://top500.org/news/fugaku-holds-top-spot-exascale-remains-elusive/)
released today, Perlmutter debuted as the 5th fastest machine on the list, 
achieving 64.6 Pflop/s on the HPL benchmark. It also ranked as the 3rd fastest 
for the HPCG benchmark and the 6th most energy efficient machine. The 
benchmarking runs that went into these ratings helped expose and accelerate 
the resolution of a number of crucial issues, but more work remains to be done.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
