### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running benchmarks successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

This week Perlmutter is undergoing a recabling, to improve its network
performance. After that we will resume system configuration and testing tasks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
