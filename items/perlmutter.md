### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon.

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive in
early 2022. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken out
of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up to 8 
weeks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
