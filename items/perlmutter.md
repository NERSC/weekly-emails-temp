### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running benchmarks successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

Perlmutter is being brought back up after the completion of the cabling task and
tests of the network. Updated OS and user software is being installed.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
