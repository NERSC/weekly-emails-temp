### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
assembled, and booting. Currently we are working on configuring and testing the
machine. Preliminary [Perlmutter Documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) is under development. As we progress, this newsletter item will be 
updated.
