### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running benchmarks successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

Updated operating system and user environments have been installed on 
Perlmutter. A few ultra-friendly users are accessing the machine. We continue to
test the machine and make improvements to its performance, rebooting it at least
twice weekly.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
