### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
assembled, and booting. We continue configuring and testing the machine. NERSC 
staff are in the beginning stages of setting up the software environment. Some
test jobs with real user applications are being run. Preliminary 
[Perlmutter Documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) 
is under development. As we progress, this newsletter item will be updated.
