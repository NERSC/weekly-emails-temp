### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running benchmarks successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

The community and home filesystems are now integrated into the machine, and
we are working on hardware stabilization and maintenance, setting up and testing 
the software environment, and running test jobs. Preliminary 
[Perlmutter Documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/)
is available and under further development.

In the [Top500 list](https://top500.org/news/fugaku-holds-top-spot-exascale-remains-elusive/)
released last month, Perlmutter debuted as the 5th fastest machine on the list, 
achieving 64.6 Pflop/s on the HPL benchmark. It also ranked as the 3rd fastest 
for the HPCG benchmark and the 6th most energy efficient machine. The 
benchmarking runs that went into these ratings helped expose and accelerate 
the resolution of a number of crucial issues, but more work remains to be done.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
