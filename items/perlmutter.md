### Perlmutter Machine Status

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. We continue configuring and testing
the machine. 

Updated operating system and user environments have been installed on 
Perlmutter. We are beginning to allow friendly users onto the machine. We hope 
to add even more users soon.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.
