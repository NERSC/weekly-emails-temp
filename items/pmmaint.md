### Perlmutter Maintenances, Explained

Perlmutter is currently undergoing a fortnightly maintenance schedule. You may
have noticed that while some of the maintenances require a system downtime,
others are rolling updates where the only disruption to users is brief
disconnections from login nodes and the possibility of a longer job start-up
time.

New system management technology allows us to perform all but the most invasive
of operations on a rolling basis. We will use this technology to minimize (but
likely not completely eliminate) Perlmutter downtime.
