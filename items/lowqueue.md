## Cori KNL Low Queue May Be Suspended in Upcoming Months

The low queue, for which users receive a discount in exchange for lower
priority, was implemented to incentivize utilization early in the year, when
utilization is traditionally low while users are ramping up. As utilization
rises over the year, NERSC may suspend access to the low queue since it is no
longer needed to encourage users to run jobs. In particular, low will be
long-ago suspended by the end of the year, when queue wait times generally
spike.

We have not yet decided on a date to suspend the low queue, but anticipate 
that it will be happen in the upcoming months. The precise date will be 
announced at least a week in advance.  When the low queue is suspended, users
will no longer be able to submit jobs to the low queue, but any existing jobs in
the low queue will still be eligible to run.
