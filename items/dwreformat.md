## DataWarp maintenance Aug 17-21: All reservations and data removed

During the August 17-21 maintenance, DataWarp will be updated This update
requires a reformat of all DataWarp SSDs, therefore **all Persistent 
Reservations will be removed** before the update. You will need to back up 
any data you wish to keep before August 17, and re-create the Persistent
Reservation afterwards if it is still required.
