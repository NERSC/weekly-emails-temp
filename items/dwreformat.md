## DataWarp Maintenance Aug 17-21: All Reservations and Data Removed

During the upcoming maintenance, DataWarp will be updated. This update
requires a reformat of all DataWarp SSDs, therefore **all Persistent 
Reservations will be removed** before the update. You will need to back up 
any data you wish to keep before Friday, and re-create the Persistent
Reservation afterwards if it is still required.
