### PIs Can Fix File Permissions with the PI Toolbox in MyNERSC

Having trouble with permissions on shared files within your project? If you're 
a NERSC PI or PI proxy, you have a new self-serve option for fixing them. 

The **PI Toolbox**, a new data-management feature within MyNERSC 
(<https://my.nersc.gov>), lets you manage file permissions through a graphical 
interface. It allows you to select individual files and directories within the 
project's CFS directory and change their group-level permissions or their 
assigned group. You can also elect to set all the files and directories within 
the shared directory to be owned by the group that owns the top-level directory 
and make them all group readable with a single button click. If you run into 
issues or have feedback about the feature, please file a ticket at 
<https://help.nersc.gov>, and we'll follow up.
