### E4S version 20.10 Spack Stack on Cori

NERSC is pleased to announce the E4S v20.10 Spack stack is now on Cori. The 
[Extreme Scale Scientific Software Stack](https://e4s-project.github.io/) (E4S) 
is a curated software stack from the Spack ecosystem, which is regularly 
re-built and tested on pre-exascale systems. The 20.10 E4S version contains 135 
installed specs that consist of many open-source projects in the 
[Exascale Computing Project](http://exascaleproject.org) (ECP).

The deployed stack is optimized for the Haswell architecture and uses the 
intel/19.1.2.254 compiler with cray-mpich/7.7.10. Additionally, we provide a 
Spack buildcache to help you install specs instantly without recompiling from 
source.  

To learn more about E4S, check out the documentation at 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/e4s>. We encourage you to experiment with 
the E4S 20.10 stack in order to help us improve subsequent e4s release. Please 
send in a ticket with any questions or comments.
