### (NEW) E4S Version 21.05 Now Available on Cori!

We are pleased to announce that the E4S version 21.05 software stack compiled
with the Intel version 19.1.3.304 compiler is now
available on Cori. E4S (the Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack) provides
popular HPC products including programming models, development tools, math
libraries, and data and visualization tools. The E4S 21.05 stack on Cori 
includes several new packages, including amex, parallel-netcdf, scr, vtk-m,
py-warpx, warpx, metall, and mpark-variant.

The E4S 21.05 stack can be accessed by running `module load e4s/21.05`, which
sets up a Spack environment with the available software stack. Module names
are easy to type and do not contain hashes. For more information, including a
