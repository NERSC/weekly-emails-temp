## Cori Maintenance Wednesday Includes CSCRATCH Outage

The July monthly maintenance for Cori begins on Wednesday at 7:00 am Pacific. 
At that time, no more user jobs will run, and the Cori login nodes will be 
inaccessible to users.

When possible, we keep Cori scratch available for users on other systems during 
a maintenance. However, because Wednesday's maintenance includes an update to 
the Cori scratch filesystem, CSCRATCH will be unavailable across all systems for
the duration of the maintenance.

At 7:00 am on Wednesday, Cori scratch will be unmounted from Edison and the Data
Transfer Nodes (DTNs). On Edison, any jobs requesting a CSCRATCH license will
not run during the maintenance. We expect that Cori, including the scratch
system, will be returned to users by 7:00 pm on Wednesday.
