### NERSC Power Maintenance July 10-14 - Many services are now back

The power maintenance work at NERSC completed late last night, slightly
ahead of schedule. Consequently, this morning we were able to begin
work related to Cori maintenance and returning NERSC systems to services.

HPSS, the $HOME and Community (/global/cfs) filesystems, Data Transfer Nodes
and non-compute auxiliary services including Iris, Spin, the NERSC website, 
and databases are now available.

At the time of writing, Cori and $CSCRATCH are still undergoing maintenance.
We are optimistic that Cori will be back well ahead of the scheduled time 
of 11.59pm Tuesday, and will send an update when it becomes available.

Thanks for your patience as we build a more robust power system in 
preparation for Perlmutter.
