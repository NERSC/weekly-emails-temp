### Monthly Cori Maintenance on Wednesday

NERSC generally performs a maintenance on the Cori system on the third
Wednesday of each month. The May maintenance will occur this Wednesday, May 20.

The May monthly maintenance includes a file system check on the Cori scratch 
file system and minor upgrades to drivers. Because of the file system check, we 
will begin the maintenance at 5 am Pacific time. A reservation is in place to 
prevent any jobs that would run past the beginning of the maintenance from 
starting. At that time, users will be logged out of the system and unable to 
access Cori or the Cori scratch file system for the duration of the maintenance.

We expect to return the machines to users before 7 pm Pacific time.
