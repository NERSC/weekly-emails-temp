### Cori Maintenance on Wednesday, March 25; Reduced Scope, Shorter Downtime

The March Cori system maintenance for this Wednesday, March 25, has been scaled
down. During this maintenance, we will simply be installing a minor patch set
and performing hardware maintenance on Cori. Because there will be less to do,
the maintenance will begin at 7:00 am (Pacific) rather than just after midnight.

During the maintenance, the Cori scratch file system will be available from
systems other than Cori. We expect to have the system returned to users before
7:00 pm on Wednesday.
