### Cori Maintenance on Wednesday, March 25

The March Cori system maintenance will begin just after midnight (Pacific time)
on Wednesday, March 25. During this maintenance, we will be upgrading the Cori
scratch software stack to a newer version. 

There will be a reservation in place to prevent jobs from running into the 
maintenance time. Any users on the system will be logged off and there will be 
no user access to the system for the duration of the outage, which is expected 
to end at 5 pm.

Note that during the maintenance, the Cori scratch file system will be
unavailable everywhere, including on the Data Transfer Nodes and through Globus.
