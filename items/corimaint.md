### Cori Monthly Maintenance on Wednesday

We will perform maintenance on Cori this Wednesday, August 19, beginning at 7:00
am (Pacific time). The maintenance will include monthly hardware repairs, a
minor patch installation, and the incorporation of new auxiliary nodes into the
system. We anticipate that the machine will be returned to users before the end
of the day.
