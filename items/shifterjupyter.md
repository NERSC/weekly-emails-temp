## Shifter Kernels Enabled on jupyter-dev.nersc.gov

Shifter also now works with jupyter-dev.nersc.gov notebooks.

To leverage Shifter through jupyter-dev, users simply define a custom kernel
that launches a provisioned Shifter image. Detailed instructions are available
at <http://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/#custom-kernels-using-shifter-containers>.

The NERSC Jupyter team has tested Shifter on jupyter-dev, but we expect some
users will find issues we did not think of. Please file a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov> if you encounter a problem.
