### "Compile" Queue Now Available on Cori!

A new "Compile" queue is now available on Cori. The 
[compile queue](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#compile) 
is intended for workflows that regularly compile codes from source, e.g., 
DevOps models leveraging Continuous Integration. There is a single Haswell node 
allocated to jobs in this queue. There is no charge for using the compile queue,
but users must request access. If you are interested in accessing the compile 
queue, please fill out the Compile Queue 
[request form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9089a22f1b426010263aa82eac4bcb5b&sysparm_category=e15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f).
