### JupyterCon 2020 Call for Proposals Now Open

JupyterCon 2020 will be held online, October 5-17.  With over 700 unique users 
per month accessing NERSC through Jupyter it has become quite apparent that 
Jupyter has become a critical platform for access to high-performance computing 
and data storage resources.  We would like to encourage users of Jupyter at 
NERSC to submit proposals for presentations, lightning talks, or online posters 
at 
<https://jupytercon.com/participate/#Call%20for%20proposals>

The call for proposals closes on July 20, 2020, and notifications will be sent
on August 10. Presenters of 30-minute conference talks are eligible for a free
pass to the main conference week.

Attending JupyterCon (virtually) would be a great way for NERSC users to gain a 
broader perspective on the Jupyter ecosystem and become power users.  For more 
background on JupyterCon 2020 and JupyterCon in general, please see:

We (at NERSC) hope to see you at JupyterCon 2020!
