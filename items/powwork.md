## Sitewide Outage for Power Upgrade, February 21-24

Over the weekend of February 22-23, there will be a facilities upgrade to the
systems that supply power to NERSC, in order to increase the amount of power
available in the machine room. This work is required in order to have enough
power to supply both Cori and Perlmutter (scheduled to arrive at the very end of
this year).

**During the outage, no NERSC systems will be available, including all 
computing, file systems, and auxiliary services.**

In preparation for the power being turned off so the electrical work may be
performed, NERSC will begin shutting off computer systems at 7:00 am (Pacific
time) on Friday, February 21. On Cori, there will be a system reservation in 
place to prevent jobs from running, but any errant jobs will be killed at that 
time and users will be logged off the machine. All systems will be offline by
5:00 pm.

After the electrical work is complete, we will begin powering the center back
up. Work on Cori will begin at 7:00 am on Monday, February 24 and a maintenance
will be performed at that time. We expect to have all systems returned to users
before midnight.
