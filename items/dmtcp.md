## User training on checkpointing and restarting jobs using DMTCP, Wednesday October 30

NERSC will host a one-hour user training on checkpoint/restart using DMTCP on 
**Wednesday October 30, 2019, from 10:00-11:00 am PT**. DMTCP is a transparent 
checkpoint/restart tool, requiring NO modifications to user codes. The goal of 
this training is to help users get started with DMTCP. The benefit of using DMTCP 
includes an improved job throughput, a [75% charging discount](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#knl) 
via the [flex](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#flex) QoS, and a capability 
of running jobs with any length on Cori. 

Registration information and agenda for the day are available at:
