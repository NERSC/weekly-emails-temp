### Nominations for James Corones Award in Leadership, Community Building & Communication Open Through December 31!

Do you know a mid-career scientist or engineer (10-20 years post-PhD) who's 
making an impact in leadership, community building, and scientific 
communication? Recognize that person's work in encouraging and mentoring young 
people to be active in the science community, to communicate their work 
effectively, and to make a difference in their scientific area, by nominating 
them for the **James Corones Award in Leadership, Community Building, and 
Communication**!

The Award was established by the Krell Institute in 2019 in honor and memory of
James "Jim" Corones, founder of the Krell Institute and advocate for mentoring

will also be covered for the winner to attend a designated event.

Nominations require a letter of support from the nominator and a form

accepted.
