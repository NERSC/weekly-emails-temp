### Tutorial on Using ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools at NERSC Rescheduled for July 16

The ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools tutorial originally scheduled for
Thursday, June 25 has been rescheduled for July 16 due to the extension of the 
center-wide electrical upgrade and power outage.

Registration is open for the ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools (DDT, MAP, and
Performance Reports) Tutorial that will now be held on Thursday, July 16 from
9 am to noon (Pacific time). Attendees will learn how to efficiently use these
popular GUI parallel debugging and profiling tools on Cori to analyze and
improve the functionality and performance of their codes. ARM Forge is an 
integrated environment for debugging (using DDT) and profiling (using MAP)
parallel codes. The Performance Reports tool analyzes the performance of an
application and helps users understand what to do for better application
performance.

We will also show you how the MAP and Performance Reports tools can be used to
profile Python applications for performance optimizations.

The training will be presented online only, using Zoom technology.
