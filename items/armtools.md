### Register Today for July 16 Tutorial on Using ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools at NERSC

Registration is open for the ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools (DDT, MAP, and
Performance Reports) Tutorial that will be held next Thursday, July 16 from
9 am to noon (Pacific time). 

In this interactive, hands-on training, attendees will learn how to efficiently 
use these popular GUI parallel debugging and profiling tools on Cori to analyze 
and improve the functionality and performance of their codes. ARM Forge is an 
integrated environment for debugging (using DDT) and profiling (using MAP)
parallel codes. The Performance Reports tool analyzes the performance of an
application and helps users understand what to do for better application
performance.

We will also show you how the MAP and Performance Reports tools can be used to
profile Python applications for performance optimizations.

Don't forget to bring your own codes to get help from one of the ARM engineers 
on profiling/optimizing them during the hands-on session!

The training will be presented online only, using Zoom technology.
