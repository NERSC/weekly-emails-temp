### Registration Open for Tutorial on Using ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools at NERSC on June 25

Registration is now open for the ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools (DDT, MAP and
Performance Reports) Tutorial that will be held on Thursday, June 25 from 9 am
to noon (Pacific time). Attendees will learn how to efficiently use these 
popular GUI parallel debugging and profiling tools on Cori to analyze and 
improve the functionality and performance of their codes. Arm Forge is an
integrated environment for debugging (using DDT) and profiling (using MAP)
parallel codes. The Performance Reports tool analyzes the performance of an
application and helps users understand what to do for better application 
performance.

The training will be presented online only, using Zoom technology.
