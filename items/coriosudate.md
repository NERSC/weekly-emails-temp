## Cori OS update during Aug 17-21 maintenance

During the maintenance that starts on Friday, Cori will be updated to CLE 6.0 
UP07. We expect existing applications to continue working as before but if you 
experience errors, re-linking your application should solve them by 
incorporating the updated system libraries.

In fact, re-linking is generally recommended in order to benefit from bugfixes 
and performance improvements in the updated system libraries.
