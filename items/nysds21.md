### Poster Abstracts for New York Scientific Data Summit Due Thursday!

The [New York Scientific Data Summit (NYSDS)](https://www.bnl.gov/nysds21), 
established by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and led by its Computational
Science Initiative, connects researchers, developers, and end-users from 
academia, industry, and government to exchange ideas, foster cross-disciplinary 
collaboration, and build a community around common data research interests.

As part of its continuing effort to accelerate data-driven discovery and 
innovation in science and industry, NYSDS 2021, to be held virtually from 
**October 26-29, 2021,** will focus on the mathematical/algorithmic, machine 
learning/AI, and high-performance computational challenges of high-consequence 
decision-making in large-scale, complex, and highly uncertain systems. 
NYSDS 2021 will feature invited presentations by researchers working in these 
areas. NYSDS 2021 will be hosted via the vFairs virtual conference platform.

We are soliciting one-page abstracts for poster sessions. These poster sessions 
will give the speakers the opportunity to showcase their research on the related
topics. We are especially interested in new and emerging research in:
- Climate and Environmental Science
- Critical Infrastructures/Agriculture/Manufacturing (Power Grid, 
Transportation, Health Care, Supply Chain, etc.)
- Health and Medicine (Cancer, COVID-19, etc.) 
- National Security
- Autonomous Systems
- Cross-Cutting Issues
   - High-Performance Computing 
   - Machine Learning/AI
   - Mathematical Foundations

 Poster abstracts can be submitted through <https://www.bnl.gov/nysds21/abstractSubmission.php>. Submissions are due **this Thursday, September 30, 2021**.
