## NX Upgrade Requires New Client to Connect <a name="nxupgrade"/> ##

In February the NERSC NX service will upgrade to a new version that includes better reliability, 
automatic client reconnection when roaming between networks, and Raspberry Pi and iOS support. 
This upgrade requires that you download a new version of the client software to connect. It is 
backwards compatible, so you can download the new version of the client now and still connect to 
the current version of the service. You can find the new version of the client software at:

Please open a ticket if you have any questions or run into issues.
