### NERSC Federated Identity Pilot Begins November 29

Starting on November 29, 2021, Berkeley Lab staff will be able to follow a
one-time process to link their Lab identity to their NERSC identity, then
subsequently use their Lab credentials to log into resources such as Iris,
ServiceNow, and the NERSC web site.

We anticipate that soon, more than two-thirds of our users
will be able to use their institutional login credentials to log into
these NERSC services.

**The appearance of the NERSC login page for these services will change when 
the rollout begins**: instead of the form requesting your
login name and password you will
see a menu where you can choose the institution to use for login.

During this first phase, if you are not Berkeley Lab staff, simply select
"NERSC" as the authentication source, and you will be sent to the
familiar NERSC authentication form. If you are Lab staff, we encourage you 
to select the "Berkeley Lab" option and try it out!
