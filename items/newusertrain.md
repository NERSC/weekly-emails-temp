### New User Training Rescheduled for Tuesday, June 16

*The NERSC New User Training, originally scheduled for this Wednesday, has been
rescheduled for Tuesday, June 16, due to a conflict with the [Science Strike for
Black Lives](https://www.particlesforjustice.org/) that was impacting several
participants as well as NERSC staff.*

Join us for the NERSC New User Training that will be held online next Tuesday,
June 16.

The purpose of the training is to provide users new to NERSC with the basics on 
our computational systems; accounts and allocations; programming environment, 
tools, and best practices; and data ecosystem.

**The training will be presented online only**, using Zoom technology.
