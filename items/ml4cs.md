### 2nd workshop on Machine Learning for Computing Systems

Researchers from NERSC, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory are organizing a workshop on Machine Learning for Computing
Systems. The workshop will be colocated with the SIAM Conference on Data Mining,
**in Cincinnati Ohio, on May 9th**.

The organizers welcome not only fully-baked research
results but also works-in-progress, extended abstracts and position papers at
the intersection of Machine learning and Systems. 

Please find [here the Call For Papers](https://mlcsworkshop.weebly.com/submission.html).
If you are interested in becoming a member of the program committee, please contact 
Kadidia Konate at `Kadidiakonate` at `lbl.gov`.
