### Keeping Our Staff Safe During the Shelter-in-Place Order

Under the shelter-in-place Order, only essential businesses are permitted to
operate, while practicing social distancing and other safety practices. You may
be concerned about what we are doing to keep our on-site staff safe during this
time.

NERSC is deeply entrenched in the Berkeley Lab safety culture, so we are doing
our best to minimize the risk to our front-line staff on-site. Normally, there
are multiple people on-site in the NERSC control room during the day. During
this period, we have reduced that to only a single person in the control room
(similar to what we do during holiday periods), with others checking in with
them periodically (virtually, of course!). When there is a shift turnover, the
staff keep at a distance to pass information, and then clean all work areas to
reduce the potential for exposure.

Sometimes, a staff member may need to come on site to perform some maintenance
work on a file system or computational system. Those staff must get permission
from their group lead and inform the control room staff about their comings and
goings. We permit only one person on the machine room floor at a time.
