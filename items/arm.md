## Debugging and Profiling with Allinea (ARM) Tools and Others, April 24, 2018

http://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/allinea-tools/

NERSC is hosting an in-depth training event on debugging and optimizing parallel
codes with ARM (previously Allinea) GUI tools by an ARM engineer. He will
provide lectures and hands-on demonstrations of how ARM tools, DDT, MAP and
Performance Reports, reduce development time, simplify debugging, and ease
application performance enhancement. He will demonstrate how to use two tools.

A NERSC consultant, will also teach how to use other useful debugging tools that
are available on Cori and Edison.

**If your code has a code bug and you want it to be analyzed with the expert's
help, please bring your code with you. If you want help with your code's
performance profiling results interpreted and get advice with optimizations,
please generate profiling results using 
[ARM MAP](http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/performance-and-debugging-tools/MAP/) 
beforehand and bring the results to the class.**
