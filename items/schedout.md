## Scheduling NERSC Outages 

At NERSC, we try to minimize the disruptions to our users' science. If it were
possible, we would leave all systems running at all times. Unfortunately, nodes
crash, hardware fails, and software requires updates.

So we do our best to minimize the amount of time we need to take machines 
offline. We do not schedule maintenance just for the sake of taking maintenance.

In previous years NERSC has sometimes delayed maintenance for the short-term 
gain of keeping users running. This has at times then snowballed into bigger 
problems that resulted in even more serious issues -- and emergency maintenances 
with longer downtimes! -- at a later date.  While we don't need to take the 
machines down every week, we do need to take a maintenance every so often.

We also received feedback from the user survey that our outage schedule was
unpredictable and did not permit users to plan around it. This was a valid
criticism, so to address these issues, we have instituted a monthly maintenance
schedule beginning in April.

During months that have no quarterly maintenance, we will schedule maintenance
for Cori and Edison on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month, 
respectively. While we may not need this maintenance every time, users can
plan for an outage and be pleasantly surprised when the machine is available,
rather than being inconvenienced by an unexpected outage.

Thanks for your patience as we deliver better reliability for you!
