## Python Data Frames GPU Acceleration Project Seeking Feedback

NERSC and NVIDIA are working together on optimizing Python data analytics 
applications that can benefit from GPU acceleration. This work will help users 
transition to the GPU nodes on Perlmutter when it arrives next year. The initial
effort is around data frames and data-frame-style data analytics, such as with 
Pandas in Python.

If you are interested in accelerating your data analytics and data-frames 
applications on GPUs, please take a moment to fill out
