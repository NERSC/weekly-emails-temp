## New Programming Environments Available after September Maintenance

Following the scheduled maintenances on Cori (September 19) and Edison 
(September 26), we will install the new Cray Programming Environment Software 
release CDT/18.09, and retire the old CDT/17.12, in compliance with the NERSC 
Programming Environment Update Policy. New Intel compiler versions 18.0.3.222 
and 19.0.0.117 will also be installed. Software defaults will remain the same.
