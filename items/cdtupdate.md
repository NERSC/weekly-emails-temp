## New Programming Environments Available after September Maintenance

During the scheduled maintenances on Cori (September 19) and Edison 
(September 26), we are installing the new Cray Programming Environment Software 
release CDT/18.09, and retiring the old CDT/17.12, in compliance with the NERSC 
Programming Environment Update Policy. A new Intel compiler version, 18.0.3.222,
is also being installed. Software defaults remain the same.
