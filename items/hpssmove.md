## NERSC HPSS Archive Move to CRT Near Completion

NERSC's HPSS archive is being moved from our Downtown Oakland facility to the 
NERSC CRT building onsite at Berkeley Lab. While equipment is being transitioned
to its new home a few users may see delays on the order of several hours for a 
small fraction of their data retrievals. This move started January 14th and 
is expected to continue through this week. If you have any questions, please 
contact NERSC consulting.
