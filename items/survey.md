## Please fill out the 2017 NERSC Survey - closes **TODAY**, Feb 5 ##

NERSC needs your feedback! Please let us know what we are doing well and 
what we can do better by filling out the NERSC User Survey. The deadline 
has been extended to the end of **TODAY, Monday, February 5.**

If you have not already filled it out, please go to <https://goo.gl/fxebNM> 
or select "NERSC 2017 User Survey" from the left-side panel of the NERSC 
Online Help Desk.

The survey is a single page, and while it is a long page, **filling out even
just the six questions in first section helps us a lot**.

Thanks in advance for helping us to better help you!
