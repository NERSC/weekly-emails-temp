### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 17 February, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our September meeting is **this Thursday, 17 February, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. Our topic-of-the-month is tentatively
**How to use and contribute to NERSC documentation for users**. 
NERSC's user-facing documentation at docs.nersc.gov is generated from 
Markdown-formatted text documents in a public Git repository, that you can 
proposed edits to. In this talk we will give an overview of what you find in 
NERSC user docs, and how you can contribute.
 
Our agenda for December is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** (Tentatively) **How to use and contribute to NERSC 
  documentation for users**. 
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
