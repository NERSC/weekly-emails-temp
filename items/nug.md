### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 16 December, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our September meeting is **this Thursday, 16 December, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. Our topic-of-the-month is 
**Preparing for AY22**. The NERSC 2021 Allocation Year (AY21) ends at 7 am 
Pacific Time on Wednesday, January 19, 2022. Cori and Perlmutter will be 
unavailable from 7 am to 8 pm on that day, and AY22 will begin. Today Helen He 
from NERSC's User Engagement Group will join us to walk through what you need to
know for the AY transition.

Our agenda for December is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** **Preparing for AY22**. We'll talk about what you need
  to know for the coming allocation year transition.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
