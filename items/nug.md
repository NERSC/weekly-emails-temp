### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 17 March, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our September meeting is **this Thursday, 17 March, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. This week Oliver Schulz from Max
Planck Institute for Physics will demonstrate how to use Shifter
containers at NERSC in combination with Visual Studio code running on
your local system/laptop to implement an efficient and fully transparent
remote development workflow, with all the tools and functionality that
developers now expect from a modern IDE.

Our agenda for this month is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** **Remote development in NERSC Shifter containers with 
  Visual Studio Code** with Oliver Schulz from Max Planck Institute for Physics. 
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
