### Apply for Prestigious Alvarez & Hopper Fellowships in Computing Sciences at Berkeley Lab & NERSC by November 22

Are you about to earn your PhD in a computational science discipline or have you
earned it within the past three years? Are you looking for a position in which 
you can set your own research agenda within the broad computing science field? 
Consider applying for the 2022 Luis W. Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellowship or 
the 2022 Admiral Grace Hopper Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Computing Sciences 
Area at Berkeley Lab!

The [Luis W. Alvarez fellowship](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/alvarez-fellowship/), 
established in 2002, offers challenging research opportunities in the 
development of computational methods and tools for scientific discovery. 
Fellows apply the latest technologies to computational modeling, simulations, 
and advanced data analysis for scientific discovery in materials science, 
biology, astronomy, environmental science, energy, particle physics, genomics, 
and other scientific domains.

The [Admiral Grace Hopper Fellowship](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/hopper-fellowship/)
was established in 2015 with the goal of developing early-career computational 
scientists to make outstanding contributions in the area of HPC applications. 
Applicants should have expertise with advanced algorithms, software techniques, 
HPC systems, and/or networking in a related research field.

Applications to both fellowships are made jointly by a single process. For
more information and to apply, please see the 
[position listing](http://m.rfer.us/LBLq6B4Aw). 
Applications close on November 22, 2021.
