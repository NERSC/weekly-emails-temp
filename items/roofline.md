### One-Day Roofline on GPUs Demo Session, April 13

Are you interested in gaining a better understanding of your application's
performance on GPUs? Do you want to learn a methodology for improving 
application performance? If so, please join us at the Roofline on GPUs 
Demo Session, which will be held on April 13.

The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive and insightful way to
understand application performance, identify bottlenecks, and perform 
optimizations for HPC applications. 

Please note that due to the current situation, we have postponed the hackathon 
component of the event.
