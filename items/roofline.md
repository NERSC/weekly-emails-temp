### Join NERSC for One-Day Roofline on GPUs Hackathon, April 13

Are you interested in gaining a better understanding of your application's
performance on GPUs? Do you want to learn a methodology for improving 
application performance? If so, please join us at the Roofline on GPUs 
Hackathon, which will be held on April 13.

The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive and insightful way to
understand application performance, identify bottlenecks, and perform 
optimizations for HPC applications. This one-day hackathon will combine a half
day of talks and demos and a half-day of hands-on sessions, to teach attendees
about the Roofline performance model and how to apply it to their applications
on GPUs using the Nsight tool.

For more information and to register, please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/roofline-on-nvidia-gpus-hackathon/>. Registration closes April 6.
