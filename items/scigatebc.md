## Applications for Science Gateways Bootcamp Close March 30 

Do you want to learn gateway building, from start to finish? If so, consider 
applying for the Incubator-organized Science Gateways Bootcamp, a week-long, 
intensive workshop for leaders of gateways who want to further develop and 
scale their work. Participants will engage in hands-on activities to help them
articulate the value of their work to key stakeholders and to create a strong
development, operations, and sustainability plan. Workshop participants work
closely together and will have the opportunity to network and establish
relationships with others engaging in similar activities.

Participation in the workshop is free, and most meals will be provided.
Attendees will need to pay for travel, hotel, and remaining meals.

The upcoming bootcamp will be held May 14-18 at the Texas Advanced Computing
Center in Austin, Texas. Bootcamps are offered twice a year, so if you can't 
make this one, there will be another session in the late (Northern-hemisphere)
summer.
