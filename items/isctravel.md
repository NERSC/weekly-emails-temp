## ISC Travel Grants for Young Researchers Closes Tomorrow

Are you at least 21 years of age, enrolled in a university degree program or
working at a research facility, and interested in acquiring knowledge in data
science or computational science or interested in using HPC skills to solve
problems in a compute-intensive or data-intensive discipline by attending the
ISC High Peformance conference in June in Frankfurt, Germany?

If so, consider applying for a travel grant to attend the conference. The
evaluation criteria include the applicant's need and lack of funding
alternatives, the estimated cost of travel and accommodation, and how the
applicant plans to pay forward the knowledge they acquire at the conference.
For more information and to apply please see
