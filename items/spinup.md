## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Apply for SpinUp Training

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It can 
be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all sorts of 
other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back end.

Completion of the SpinUp instructional workshop is required for access. Applications 
are now open for sessions in early September. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so 
space is limited.

Participants will attend two instructional sessions and a hack-a-thon to learn about 
the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and troubleshooting 
techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

See a video of Spin in action, check the workshop schedule, and apply at the
