### Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Next SpinUp Workshop Starts June 10! 

Spin is a service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy science gateways, workflow managers, databases, and all 
sorts of other services that can access NERSC systems and storage on the back 
end. New large-memory nodes have been added to the platform, increasing the
potential of the platform for new memory-constrained applications.
To learn more about how Spin works and what it can do, please listen to the
NERSC User News podcast on Spin: 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Spin--Interview-with-Cory-Snavely-and-Val-Hendrix-e1pa7p>.

Attend an upcoming SpinUp workshop to learn to use Spin for your own science 
gateway projects! Applications for sessions that begin 
on [Thursday June 10](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/spin/)
are now open. SpinUp is hands-on and interactive, so space is limited.

Participants will attend an instructional session and a hack-a-thon to learn 
about the platform, create running services, and learn maintenance and 
troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote participants are welcome.

If you can't make these upcoming sessions, never fear! The next session begins
August 19, and we'll hold additional sessions in October and December.
