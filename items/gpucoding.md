### Sign up for Training on "Coding for GPUs Using Standard C++", April 7

CUDA C++, CUDA Fortran, and OpenACC are highly successful approaches to GPU
programming, but wouldn't it be even better to write an application capable of
running on GPUs and multicore CPUs out of the box, without any additional APIs?
Join us for the first event in a series covering how ISO C++ and ISO Fortran
can be used as a portable solution to parallel programming targeting both
GPUs and CPUs. This online-only training given by NVIDIA will take place
from 11 am to noon (Pacific time) on Thursday, April 7.
