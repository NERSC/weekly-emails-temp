### Resolution of cscratch1 issues 

During the NERSC facility power upgrade last week, fixes were deployed for 
the bugs that led to the cscratch1 outage in September and October. We are
confident that the problem is now fully resolved.

We still recommend setting Lustre file striping with consideration for the 
file size, and using the NERSC-provided helper scripts - please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/io/lustre/#nersc-file-striping-recommendations> 
for details.
