## Potential Impacts on NERSC from California Wildfire Season

PG&E, which provides power to Berkeley Lab (and NERSC), is taking a more
conservative approach to wildfire prevention, which may result in power lines
being de-energized and the power to the NERSC machine room being cut with little
advance notice. While the chances are low that this will happen, NERSC has
plans for shutting down Cori smoothly (with enough advance warning) and
informing users. Users can also look at <http://status.lbl.gov/> to find out the
latest status of NERSC as well as Berkeley Lab as a whole.
