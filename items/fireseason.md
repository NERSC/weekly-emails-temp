## Potential Impacts on NERSC from California Wildfire Season

PG&E, which provides power to Berkeley Lab (and NERSC), is taking a conservative
approach to wildfire prevention by de-energizing power lines during high-risk 
weather. The recent power outage at NERSC was a consequence of this and, while 
we hope it will not happen again, while there is a risk of wildfires there is a 
chance that our power will again be cut with little notice. We plan to keep our
users well-informed of events if this should happen again, and <http://status.lbl.gov/> 
will continue to indicate the status of Berkeley Lab as a whole.
