### (UPDATE) Cori Operating System Upgrade Postponed

The operating system upgrade planned for the September 15 Cori maintenance has
been postponed until early 2022. We plan to keep user default programming 
environments unchanged for the remainder of the allocation year, unless
circumstances require an emergency update.
