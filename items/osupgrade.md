### Cori Operating System Upgrade & New Default Enivronment Coming in August or September

To continue to be in compliance with minimum requirements for support from
HPE/Cray, NERSC will perform a minor version upgrade to the operating system on
Cori later this year. The upgrade itself is currently expected to take only one 
day, but we will analyze the required steps further, and may extend the estimate
if necessary.

At the same time, we will also **update the default user programming 
environment** on Cori for the first time since January, 2020. The precise CDT 
version we will install is still to be determined. We expect that the changes 
to the operating system and default programming environment will at a minimum
require users to relink all statically compiled codes, and NERSC plans to 
update all NERSC-supported software to be compatible with the new operating 
system and CDT at that time.

The precise date of the upgrade is also still to be determined, but we expect 
that it will be performed during one of the regular monthly maintenance periods 
in August or September.
