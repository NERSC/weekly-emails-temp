### Cori Operating System Upgrade & New Default Enivronment Coming in September

To continue to be in compliance with minimum requirements for support from
HPE/Cray, NERSC will perform a minor version upgrade to the operating system on
Cori later this year. The upgrade itself is currently expected to take only one 
day, but we will analyze the required steps further, and may extend the estimate
if necessary.

At the same time, we will also **update the default user programming 
environment** on Cori for the first time since January, 2020. The CDT version
will change from 19.11 to **21.05**, and the Intel compiler default will change 
from 19.0.3.199 to **19.1.2.254**. Users will need to relink all statically 
compiled codes, and NERSC plans to update all NERSC-supported software to be 
compatible with the new operating system and CDT.

This update is scheduled for the September Cori monthly maintenance.
