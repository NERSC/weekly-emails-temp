### Need Help? Check out NERSC Documentation or Send in a Ticket!

Are you confused about setting up your MFA token? Is there something not quite 
right with your job script that causes the job submission filter to reject it? 
Are you struggling to understand the performance of your code on the KNL nodes?

There are many ways that you can get help with issues at NERSC: 
- First, we recommend the NERSC documentation (<https://docs.nersc.gov/>).
Usually the answers for simpler issues, such as setting up your MFA token using
Google Authenticator, can be found there. (Often the answers to more
complex issues are in the documentation too!)
- For more complicated issues, or issues that leave you unable to work,
submitting a ticket is a good way to get help fast. NERSC's consulting team
will get back to you within four business-hours (8 am - 5 pm, Monday through
Friday, except holidays) with a response. To submit a ticket, log in to
<https://help.nersc.gov> (or, if the issue is stopping you from logging in, send
an email to <accounts@nersc.gov>).
- Sometimes, a colleague can figure out the issue faster than NERSC, because
they already understand your workflow. It's possible that they know what flag
you need to add to your Makefile for better performance, or how to set up your
job submission script just so.
