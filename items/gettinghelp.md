### Need Help? Check out NERSC Documentation, Send in a Ticket or Consult Your Peers!

Are you confused about setting up your MFA token? Is there something not quite 
right with your job script that causes the job submission filter to reject it? 
Are you struggling to understand the performance of your code on the KNL nodes?

There are many ways that you can get help with issues at NERSC: 
- First, we recommend the NERSC documentation (<https://docs.nersc.gov/>).
Usually the answers for simpler issues, such as setting up your MFA token using
Google Authenticator, can be found there. (The answers to more complex issues 
can be found in the documentation too!)
- For more complicated issues, or issues that leave you unable to work,
submitting a ticket is a good way to get help fast. NERSC's consulting team
will get back to you within four business-hours (8 am - 5 pm, Monday through
Friday, except holidays) with a response. To submit a ticket, log in to
<https://help.nersc.gov> (or, if the issue prevents you from logging in, send
an email to <accounts@nersc.gov>).
- For queries that might require some back-and-forth, NERSC provides an
[appointment service](https://docs.nersc.gov/getting-started/#appointments-with-nersc-user-support-staff). 
Sign up for an appointment on a variety of topics, including "NERSC 101", KNL 
Optimization, Containers at NERSC, NERSC File Systems, GPU Basics, GPUs in
Python, and Checkpoint/Restart. 
- The NERSC Users Group Slack, while not an official channel for help, is a
place where NERSC users often answer each others' questions, such as whether
anyone else is seeing something strange, or how to get better job
throughput. You can join the NUG Slack by following 
[this link](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/nersc-users-slack/) (login required)
- Sometimes, a colleague can figure out the issue faster than NERSC, because
they already understand your workflow. It's possible that they know what flag
you need to add to your Makefile for better performance, or how to set up your
job submission script just so.
