## Iris to replace NIM in 2020, launching December 2

NIM has served NERSC well for over 20 years and is ready to retire! Over the last 12
months we have been developing [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov) which is a modern, fast
and intuitive interface for managing your NERSC account and resource usage.

Current Iris is running in read-only mode - meaning you can use it to look at your 
details and usage, but not change them yet. On December 2, NIM will be set to read-only
mode and Iris will become the primary interface for managing your NERSC account.

A number of NERSC staff and users have been testing Iris, and we encourage you to 
log in, look around and [let us know about any problems you encounter](https://help.nersc.gov). 
Remember that changes you make in Iris before December 2 will not take effect.
