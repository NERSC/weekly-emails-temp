Day 1 will begin with a brief recap and updated overview of the Perlmutter 
hardware and programming environment, followed by building and running
applications on Perlmutter. Day 2 will introduce the HPE profiling and
debugging tools, which are primarily CPU focused. The last day will include
GPU basics, an overview of GPU programming models, and using Jupyter, Python,
and Machine Learning / Deep Learning on Perlmutter. Each day includes hands-on
exercises.
