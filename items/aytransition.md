### Allocation Year 2021 to 2022 Transition on Wednesday, January 19, 2022

The current Allocation Year (AY21) ends at 7 am Pacific Time on Wednesday,
January 19, 2022.

PIs for new and continuing projects will receive notification of the status of 
their project request later this week.

There are a few changes for AY22. Of note:
- **Charge factors have been recalibrated to the new Perlmutter machine.** The 
new currency, "CPU Node Hours", are 1/400th the size of the former "NERSC Hours"
currency. Using one hour of time on a Cori Haswell node will cost 0.34 CPU Node
Hours, and one hour of time on a Cori KNL will cost 0.2 CPU Node Hours. When we
begin charging for Perlmutter (which will likely happen for the second half of
the year), the charge for a single Perlmutter CPU node for one hour will be 1.0.
- **Two separate allocations for CPU and GPU architectures.** Projects will have
allocations on CPU and GPU architectures, which are separate and cannot be
traded or exchanged.
- **New default Python Module at AY Transition.** Please see the 
[entry](#python) on this topic below.
- **Cori defaults will change in March, 2022.** Cori defaults will remain the
same at the AY transition, but the machine will undergo what we hope will be its
final major system upgrade during the March maintenance, at which time the
default user environment will be updated.
