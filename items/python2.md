## NERSC Will Support Only Python3 in New Allocation Year

Python 2 will reach its end of life on [January 1, 2020](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches),
at which point there will be no more development, bug fixes, patches, etc.

Therefore, upon the beginning of the 2020 Allocation Year at NERSC, the 
following changes to Python support will occur at NERSC:
- At the AY rollover, the default Python module will become a module based on a
Python 3 distribution.
- The old Python 2 module will remain available for use but users must specify
the version suffix.
- No new installations of Python 2 packages or modules will be performed.
- During the next Cori operating system upgrade, which could occur sometime in
2020, the Python 2 module will be retired.

NERSC will actively support only Python 3 (or future Python versions should
Python 3 become deprecated) on Perlmutter and future systems.
