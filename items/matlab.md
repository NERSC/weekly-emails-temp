## MATLAB Maintenance for Toolbox Enhancements

On Wednesday, October 9, between 10 am and noon pacific time, MATLAB at
NERSC will undergo scheduled maintenance for installations. We are
making the symbolic math toolbox available and adding additional license
seats for the signal processing and statistics and machine learning
toolboxes. **Please be sure to log out of any MATLAB sessions**, including
those running in NX, in advance.
