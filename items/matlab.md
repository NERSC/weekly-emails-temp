## MATLAB Maintenance for Toolbox Enhancements - moved to this Thursday

The MATLAB maintenance scheduled last week has been moved due to the power 
outage, to this **Thursday, October 17**, between 10 am and noon pacific time. 
We are making the symbolic math toolbox available and adding additional license
seats for the signal processing and statistics and machine learning
toolboxes. **Please be sure to log out of any MATLAB sessions**, including
those running in NX, in advance.
