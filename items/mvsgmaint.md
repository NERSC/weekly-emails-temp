### NERSC Electrical Systems Maintenance Weekend of July 10

NERSC will have an electrical-systems maintenance the weekend of July 10. The 
medium-voltage switchgear that transforms power from transmission voltage to 
usable voltage will undergo a required inspection and maintenance. This means
that **nearly all NERSC resources will be unavailable during the maintenance.**
The medium-voltage switchgear maintenance itself is scheduled for July 10, and 
NERSC may perform additional maintenance tasks while everything is already down.
More details will be provided as we create a more detailed schedule.
