### Sign Up for April 19 & 26 Timemory ECP Tutorial to Simplify Monitoring Your Application

The Timemory toolkit is a suite of C/C++/Fortran/Python tools for performance
analysis, optimization studies, logging, and debugging, that can be used to
easily integrate and maintain the exact set of measurements/tools/features you
want to support with an interface best suited for your application. Timemory 
helps you simplify the monitoring of the state and performance of your
application so that relevant debugging, logging, and performance data can be trivially enabled or disabled in a consistent and portable manner.

The Timemory tutorial, to be held across two successive Mondays, April 19 & 26,
will introduce the user to Timemory, its command-line tools and APIs, and how
to use the individual components to build a custom tool.

The tutorial is sponsored by ECP, but open and available to all. Registration is
required. For more information and to register, please see
