### Webinar on Evaluating Modern Programming Models using the Parallel Research Kernels Tomorrow at 10 am

The following seminar associated with an OpenMP hackathon being held this week
is open to all interested NERSC users. 

**Evaluating Modern Programming Models using the Parallel Research Kernels**

**Speaker:** Jeff Hammond, Intel

**Date:** Tuesday, January 26 10:00-11:00am PST

**Abstract:** Especially with the advent of complex node architectures on 
supercomputers in the last decade, we have seen a large collection of parallel 
programming models that include OpenMP, Kokkos, RAJA, and OpenShmem emerge. The 
talk will be about evaluating the various parallel programming models through 
Parallel Research Kernels, which are motivated by parallel computing motifs, or 
common computational patterns in parallel scientific applications, as described 
in the set of Computational Patterns here:
