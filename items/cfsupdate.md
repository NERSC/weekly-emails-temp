### Preparation Work for Community File System Expansion Ongoing

The Community File System will be expanded later this year. As part of this 
process, a behind-the-scenes data migration is taking place to new hardware. We 
don't anticipate much performance impact, but wanted to share this news with 
users. Stay tuned for more updates about this expansion as we advance to the 
next steps later this year.
