## Parallel Data Storage & Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems Workshop Call for Submissions Now Open

The Joint International Workshop on Parallel Data Storage and Data Intensive 
Scalable Computing Systems (PDSW-DISCS'18) is accepting submissions for short 
papers and work-in-progress abstracts related to addressing challenges in 
high-performance parallel I/O, data management, and experimental and 
observational data.  Special attention will be given to issues in which 
community collaboration can be crucial for problem identification, workload 
capture, solution interoperability, standards with community buy-in, and shared 
tools.

The workshop will be held on November 12, 2018 in conjunction with SC18.  For 
more information on guidelines and relevant topic areas, see
