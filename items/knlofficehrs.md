## Need Help Switching to Cori KNL Nodes? Final KNL Office Hours Friday

The final instance instance in a series of virtual office hours to help users 
get their codes running efficiently on the Cori KNL nodes will be this Friday, 
January 31 from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm Pacific Time.

For many users, running efficiently on the KNL nodes is as simple as making sure
that their job script is set to request the proper thread affinity on the node,
and their executable is compiled correctly to exploit the KNL architecture. We
have seen a performance gap shrink by a factor of 7 just with these two simple
steps.

Other user codes may require some relatively straightforward code changes (for
example, a loop reordering to exploit vectorization). Profiling the code is the
first step towards finding these hot spots or bottlenecks.

During the KNL Office Hours, NERSC experts will be on hand to help you take
these steps. Please (virtually) drop by for help with
- Setting up your job script for proper thread affinity
- Compiling your code with the best optimization flags
- Getting started with profiling your code
- Interpreting the results of profiling, and advice on how to proceed
