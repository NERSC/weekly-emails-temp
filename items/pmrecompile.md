### Recompile Strongly Recommended After Today's Perlmutter Maintenance

The Perlmutter maintenance scheduled for today and tomorrow is a major upgrade. 
We are updating the operating system and changing the default modules to 
simplify and unify the programming environment, and also updating the network 
software. Because of these changes, we recommend that you recompile your codes 
after Perlmutter returns from this maintenance. We expect to post exact
details of the changes and links to any new instructions on Perlmutter's
timeline page (<https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/timeline/>) tomorrow.
