### Recompile Strongly Recommended After Upcoming Maintenance on Perlmutter

The upcoming maintenance on Perlmutter, scheduled for the week of 12/6, is a
major upgrade. We will be updating the operating system and changing the default
modules to simplify and unify the programming environment as well as updating
the network software. Because of these changes, we recommend that you recompile
your codes after Perlmutter returns from this maintenance. We will post exact
details of the changes and links to any new instructions on Perlmutter's
timeline page (https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/timeline/)  as the date
approaches.
