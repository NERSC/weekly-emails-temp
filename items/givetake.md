## Purging of Old Files in give/take Staging Area Has Begun!

NERSC now purges files from the 
[give/take](https://docs.nersc.gov/data/sharing/#givetake) 
staging area that are more than 12 weeks old. We expect this to have minimal 
impact on users, since files untaken after 12 weeks are mostly unwanted.
