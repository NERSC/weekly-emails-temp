## Purging of old files in give/take staging area

Beginning in August, we will purge files from the 
[give/take](https://docs.nersc.gov/data/sharing/#givetake) staging area that are more
than 12 weeks old. We expect this to have minimal impact on users, since files untaken 
after 12 weeks are mostly unwanted, but if you have been delaying taking a file that
a collaborator gave you, please do so before the end of July
