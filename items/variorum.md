### Using Variorum for Portable Power Management Code, August 20 & 27

[Variorum](https://github.com/LLNL/variorum) is a production-grade, open-source,
vendor-neutral software infrastructure for exposing low-level control and
monitoring of a system's underlying hardware features that can allow users to
manage power, performance, and thermal information seamlessly across hardware
from different vendors.

The Variorum team will provide its first Variorum Lecture Series, where
attendees will learn everything necessary to start using Variorum on various
platforms to write portable power management code. The Lecture Series consists
of two 90-minute modules. Remaining sessions will be held:
- Session 2: August 20 and 27, 4:00 pm - 5:30 pm (Pacific Time)

The sessions are free but registration is required. For more information please
