### NUG Meeting Slides and Livestream Available

Today's NERSC User Group Annual Meeting was livestreamed today. If you missed
part of the meeting or wanted to take a look at some of it, you can peruse the 
slides or watch the recorded livestream.

This year's theme was Perlmutter, which is arriving at the very end of this 
year. Learn about the features and capabilities of the system, plus our plans 
for software and services, resources for getting your applications running on 
the GPUs, and how and when users will be able to access the machine. Breakout
sessions were held on topics such as AI and deep learning on Perlmutter, ERCAP
and Iris tricks and tips, application performance portability, and experimental
data best practices. User talks on their experiences and scientific results were
featured in a round of lightning talks.
