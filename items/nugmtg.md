### Register Today for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting Next Monday, August 17!

Registration is open for the NERSC User Group Annual Meeting, which is being
held online next Monday, August 17. 

This year's theme is Perlmutter, which is arriving at the very end of this year.
Learn about the features and capabilities of the system, plus our plans for
software and services, resources for getting your applications running on the
GPUs, and how and when users will be able to access the machine. Join a
breakout session on a topic such as AI and deep learning on Perlmutter, ERCAP
and Iris tricks and tips, application performance portability, or experimental
data best practices. User talks on their experiences and scientific results will
be featured in a round of lightning talks.
