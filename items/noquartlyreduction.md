### No quarterly allocation reductions in 2020

We have heard that users don't like long queue waits or having unused
time automatically removed from their allocation balances. So NERSC is
eliminating quarterly allocation reductions for 2020. Historically,
NERSC automatically removed time from projects that were using their
allocation slowly and the time was redistributed to others,
contributing to a glut of allocation and long queue waits later in the
year. While reductions will not happen automatically, we'd like to
remind you that the DOE Allocation Manager who made your award has the
ability to reallocate resources among projects during the year to meet
DOE priorities.
