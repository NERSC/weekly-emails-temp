## Changes to Charging for the "Flex" and "Low" QOS!

Effective June 10, the discounts on the "flex" and "low" queues have been 
reduced.
- Jobs in the flex queue will receive a 75% discount (a user running a job that 
would cost 1000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 250 
NERSC-hours).
- Jobs in the low queue will receive a 25% discount (a user running a job that
would cost 10,000 NERSC-hours in the regular queue will now be charged 7500
NERSC-hours).

For more information on using the flex queue, please see
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#flex> for information about the QOS, and
 - <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/examples/#variable-time-jobs> about running
variable-time jobs.
