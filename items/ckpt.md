### Submit to SuperCheck21 Before Next Monday, December 14!  

NERSC invites you to participate in the First International Symposium on
Checkpointing for Supercomputing (SuperCheck21), which will be held February 
4-5, 2021, online.

The Call for Participation is now open. We invite researchers, end-users,
professionals, and students to participate by submitting an abstract. Topics of
interest include (but are not limited to):
- Checkpoint/Restart (C/R) research and tools development
    - C/R targeting the full range of supercomputing software
    - Pure and hybrid approaches to transparent checkpointing
    - Development of new methods for low-overhead checkpointing, new algorithms,
software development methods, impact of future hardware, performance evaluation,
reproducibility, fault recovery
    - C/R scheduling and intervals
- C/R use in production, including all levels of checkpointing (application,
job, and system levels)
    - Adoption of transparent C/R tools in production workloads
    - Application-initiated use of C/R tools
    - C/R applications and support on HPC systems

For more information and to submit (or to register for the free symposium)
please see <https://ckpt-symposium.lbl.gov/>. The deadline for submissions is
**next Monday, December 14.**
