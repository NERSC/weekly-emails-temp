### Introduction to Programming with SYCL on Perlmutter & Beyond, Tomorrow!

SYCL is an open-standard programming model that allows developers to program for
a range of GPUs and other accelerator processors using standard C++ code. This
means your standard C++ code can target Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs from a
single code base. Engineers from Codeplay have partnered with national labs to
bring SYCL support to Perlmutter, Polaris, and Frontier.

Join Codeplay engineers tomorrow for a half-day, hands-on workshop covering 
the fundamentals of SYCL programming, including practical examples and exercises
to help reinforce the concepts being learned. Attendees will learn how to 
compile their SYCL code using the DPC++ compiler to target Nvidia GPUs such as 
on Perlmutter. We'll end with useful tips to achieve good performance, including
best practices for memory management, with free time for questions and
discussions.
