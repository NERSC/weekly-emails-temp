### April Monthly Maintenance on Wednesday

This month's Cori maintenance will take place on Wednesday. Coinciding with the
Cori monthly maintenance will be a maintenance on the Global Homes and Global
Common file systems. The Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) will also be unavailable for
the duration of the maintenance. Work will begin at 7:00 am (Pacific) on 
Wednesday, April 21, and is expected to complete before 8:00 pm that day.

When Cori returns from maintenance, there will be two additions to the Cori
Haswell queue policy: a new [Flex QOS capability](#hwflex) and a
[job size limit](#hwres) of 512 nodes.
