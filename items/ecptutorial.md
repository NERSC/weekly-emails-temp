### Join December 17 ECP Tutorial on Scientific Visualization & Analysis Using Alpine Ascent

Are you looking for a visualization solution that does not require you to wait
for a post-processing phase to visualize your data? Do you want a solution
unconstrained by the gaps between I/O and compute speeds, that can leverage the
compute resources allocated to your existing simulation? If so, consider
registering for the December 17 tutorial on using Alpine Ascent, sponsored
by the ECP project.

Ascent, one of the infrastructure thrusts of the ECP ALPINE Software Technology
Project, aims to do just that. It supports production of in-memory 
visualizations for HPC simulations by leveraging both distributed-memory and 
many-core parallelism to provide ray-tracing, contouring, and more, using the
same HPC resources as its host simulation application.

The December 17 Tutorial will teach you how to present data to Ascent, and how
to transform data, render pictures, and export results. Attendees can follow
along and execute tutorial examples using cloud-hosted jupyter notebooks or a
public Ascent installation. For more information and to register, please see
