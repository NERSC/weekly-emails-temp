### Four-Day CMake Training, August 23-26

ECP is partnering with Kitware, ALCF, NERSC, and OLCF to offer a four-day CMake
training August 23-26. CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools
designed to build, test, and package software.

The training is targeted at a deeper understanding of CMake, to assist
developers in learning to resolve issues outside their control, and to write a
build system generator capable of seamlessly configuring for multiple unique
architectures with a variety of compilers.

The training will take place from 9 am to 1 pm (Pacific time) Monday through
Thursday, August 23-26. It will be fully virtual and use NERSC resources for
exercises. The first 3 days will include lectures and hands-on exercises, and
the last day will be office hours and a Q&A session.

All NERSC users are welcome to attend the training. For more information,
