### Update on Perlmutter Preparation Process

NERSC staff are working tirelessly to prepare the system for the NERSC user
community and ensure that the user environment is stable and well integrated
with NERSC resources. Deploying a machine such as Perlmutter with its new
networking, storage, and system software technologies is a very challenging
endeavor in the best of times, and this has been complicated by the 
ever-changing pandemic conditions.

Some processes are taking longer than we had hoped due to safety constraints.
For example, assembly of the machine is normally performed by a large group of
assemblers; this process had to be adapted for pandemic safety requirements. We 
continue to adapt to these new challenges and look forward to welcoming the
first users onto Perlmutter as soon as the system is ready.
