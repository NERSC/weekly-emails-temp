### Data Analytics in Python on GPUs with NVIDIA RAPIDS, April 14, 2020

NERSC and NVIDIA are pleased to announce an all-day training event at NERSC on
**Tuesday, April 14, 2020** to teach NERSC users about the NVIDIA RAPIDS 
software ecosystem for GPU-accelerated data analytics and machine learning.

The RAPIDS data science framework includes a collection of libraries for
executing end-to-end data science pipelines completely in the GPU, and is
designed to have a familiar look and feel to data scientists working in Python.
We expect RAPIDS to become an essential way for Python users to do data
analytics on Perlmutter's GPUs.  Join us and learn directly from the developers
how to transition your Python-based data analytics workflows to GPUs.

As part of the training, attendees will be given access to the Cori GPU testbed
to try exercises and try porting their own codes.  Access to the GPUs will
continue to be available to participants for a few days after the event for
further testing.
