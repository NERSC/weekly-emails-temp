### Call for Participation: Monterey Data Workshop, April 20-21, 2022

The DOE Monterey Data Workshop 2022 is a virtual 2-day meeting to share the 
latest research in scientific artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(ML) in preparation for the Fall 2022 Monterey Data Conference. The Workshop
brings together researchers from DOE national laboratories, facilities,
universities, and industry to share research in AI and ML. The two primary goals
of this meeting are to
- Share best practices and cutting-edge research on scientific AI/ML and broaden
participation in the field
- Identify key challenges and technologies in scientific machine learning that
will shape invited speakers and discussion at the fall Monterey Data
Conference, an invite-only event attended by lab leaders, leading academic and
industry partners.

The workshop is designed to promote discussion and feedback. The meeting, a
comibination of technical talks, panel/breakout sessions, and time for informal
interactions with colleagues, will be held virtually and may provide an on-site
venue at Berkeley Lab if possible.

The organizers are seeking speakers to give short (~20 minute) talks on 
progress, ideas, and/or challenges on AI/ML. We encourage talks from 
early-career scientists and prioritize talks in the following topical areas:
- Scalable and productive computing systems for AI
- Interpretable, robust, science-informed AI methods
- Novel scientific AI applications at large scale
- AI for self-driving scientific facilities

We are also soliciting ideas for breakout sessions and volunteers to lead these
sessions related to the above topics.

Submissions are due **next Monday, January 31, 2022**.
