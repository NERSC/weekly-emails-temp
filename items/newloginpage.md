## New NERSC Login Page Is Live

The look of the web page that you use for logging into the NERSC help desk,
NERSC web site, and other web-based services at NERSC has changed! The new
page features a streamlined design, provides a better experience on mobile 
devices, and will help extend the use of Multi-Factor Authentication and single 
sign-on to additional web services at NERSC.

We are announcing this change to minimize the suprise and suspicion that can
occur when there is a change in the page you use for entering your credentials.
Normally, if you were to see a change in the NERSC login page, we would ask you
to let us know either via a ticket, or a phone call to 1-800-66-NERSC, because
it could be the sign of a phishing site interposing between you and NERSC. But 
in this case, since we are letting you know that this is happening, if you
notice this change today, there is no cause for alarm.
