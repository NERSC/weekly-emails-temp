### (UPDATED) Large Memory Nodes on Cori and Spin Available to Users

The new [Cori Large Memory](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori-largemem/)
("cmem") system, consisting of 20 nodes each with 2 TB memory and two 16-core
3.0 GHz AMD EPYC 7302 (Rome) processors and 3 TB local SSD disk, is available
for use. Prospective users must apply for access via the
[cmem access request form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7c79b5961bb750506c44ebdbac4bcb6e%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The nodes are available to all NERSC users upon approval. Projects performing 
COVID-19 related research or with strong scientific use cases that have a need 
for the nodes' architectural characteristics will be prioritized. Usage is
charged at the Cori Haswell rate. If you are performing COVID-19 related
research and require additional allocation to support your work, please indicate
that on the form when you apply.

The Spin container-based platform at NERSC was upgraded with a new cluster of
large-memory nodes to support a broader range of services, including those with
memory footprints as large as 1-2 TB, such as 
- epidemiological models used to study the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
- large in-memory databases,
- memory-intensive web applications.
Though Spin is intended for persistent services rather than HPC workloads, the 
large-memory nodes in the new cluster are also well-equipped to satisfy bursts 
of computing and I/O demand from services, with 64 AMD EPYC cores each, 
SSD-based local storage, and SSD-cached attached storage.

If you're interested in using these resources, please 
[contact NERSC](https://help.nersc.gov) with more details about your project.
