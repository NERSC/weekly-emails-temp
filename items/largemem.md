### New Form for Requesting Access to Cori Large Memory Nodes

The new [Cori Large Memory](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori-largemem/)
system, consisting of 20 nodes each with 2 TB memory and two 16-core
3.0 GHz AMD EPYC 7302 (Rome) processors and 3 TB local SSD disk, is available
for use. Prospective users must apply for access. We have recently updated and 
streamlined the 
[access request form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7c79b5961bb750506c44ebdbac4bcb6e%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The nodes are available to all NERSC users upon approval. Projects performing 
COVID-19 related research or with strong scientific use cases that have a need 
for the nodes' architectural characteristics will be prioritized. Usage is
charged at the Cori Haswell rate. If you are performing COVID-19 related
research and require additional allocation to support your work, please indicate
that on the form when you apply.
