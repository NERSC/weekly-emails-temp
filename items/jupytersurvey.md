### Last Chance! Jupyter Experience Survey Closes Sunday

If you use Project Jupyter tools on HPC systems, we want to hear from you! 
Don't forget to participate in the Jupyter Experience Survey before it closes on
Sunday! The survey requires only 5-10 minutes of your time to complete. Please 
fill out the online survey at: <https://forms.gle/G4mS5KG158pQgVno8>.

Researchers from the Data Science and Technology Department at Lawrence Berkeley
National Lab (Berkeley Lab) are conducting a survey of scientific researchers 
working with simulation and data analysis software at HPC facilities as part of 
the Usable Data Abstractions (UDA) project. This survey will help us better 
understand how such work is conducted using Project Jupyter tools (Notebooks, 
Lab, Hub, etc.) supported at facilities like NERSC. The results will be used to
inform the development and deployment of next-generation workflow tools and data
abstractions to make them more intuitive to use and better match the way 
scientists understand and think about their data, and to identify opportunities 
to improve the NERSC Jupyter experience. **If your research work uses Project 
Jupyter tools on HPC systems then we are seeking your participation in our
study**.

If you have any further questions about taking part in this study, please 
contact Dr. Lavanya Ramakrishnan at 510-486-4384. Any questions you have about 
your rights as a potential research subject can be answered by the Berkeley Lab 
Human Subjects Committee at 510-486-6005.
