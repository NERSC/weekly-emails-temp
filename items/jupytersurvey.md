### Help us improve your Jupyter experience (survey)

Researchers from the Data Science and Technology Department at
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) are conducting a survey of
scientific researchers working with simulation and data analysis
software at HPC facilities as part of the Usable Data Abstractions
(UDA) project. This survey will help us better understand how such
work is conducted using Project Jupyter tools (Notebooks, Lab, Hub,
etc.) supported at facilities like NERSC. The results will inform the
development and deployment of next generation workflow tools and data
abstractions that are intuitive to use and better match the way
scientists understand and think about their data as well as identify
opportunities to improve the NERSC Jupyter experience. **If your
research work uses Project Jupyter tools on HPC systems then we are
interested in your participation in our study**.

Participating in this study would involve spending 5-10 minutes
completing our online survey by following this link:

If you have any further questions about taking part in this study you
may contact Dr. Lavanya Ramakrishnan at 510-486-4384.

Any questions you have about your rights as a potential research
subject will be answered by the Berkeley Lab Human Subjects Committee
