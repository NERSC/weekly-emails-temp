### User Information Transmitted to DOE SC

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (SC), which is the primary 
sponsor of NERSC, requires that a limited set of information relating to your 
user project/experiment be transmitted to SC at the conclusion of the current 
fiscal year. A subset of this information, including your name, institutional 
affiliation(s), and project title(s), will be publicly disseminated as part of 
an SC user facility user projects/experiments database on the SC website, 
<https://science.osti.gov/>, after the conclusion of the fiscal year. For 
proprietary projects, SC requests that the user provide a project title that is 
suitable for public dissemination.
