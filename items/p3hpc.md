## Call For Papers: Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC Forum (P3HPC)

The call for papers for the Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC Forum
(P3HPC) is now open. This workshop is an opportunity for
researchers to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for 
tackling the compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance, 
portability and productivity.
 
We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of 
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composability challenges 
arising from the use of bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" 
applications in the long term.

Submissions close January 24, 2020. For more information and to submit a paper,
