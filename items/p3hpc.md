## Call For Papers: International Workshop on Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC)

The call for papers for the  International Workshop on Performance, Portability 
and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) is now open. This workshop is an opportunity for
researchers to share ideas, practical experiences, and methodologies for 
tackling the compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance, 
portability and productivity.
 
We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of 
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composability challenges 
arising from the use of bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" 
applications in the long term.

Submissions close August 27, 2018. For more information and to submit a paper,
