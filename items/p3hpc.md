### (NEW) Call for Papers: International Workshop on Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC

The 2021 International Workshop on Performance, Portability, and Productivity
in HPC will be held on Sunday, November 14, 2021, in conjunction with SC21 in
St. Louis, Missouri. P3HPC provides a forum for researchers and application
developers to discuss their successes and failures in tackling the compelling
problems that lie at the intersection of performance, portability, and
productivity and High-Performance Computing.

Authors are invited to submit novel research from areas concerned with
performance, portability, and productivity. We are particularly interested in
research that addresses the complexities of real-life applications and/or
realistic workloads, the composability challenges arising from the use of 
bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" applications through an era
of increased heterogenity and new emerging architectures. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:
- Extensions to HPC languages
- Directives, libraries, domain-specific languages, and other abstractions
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- Techniques specifically designed for use with legacy codes
- Impact of increasing complexity of workflows on P3 analysis
- Preparing applications for future architectural changes
- Measuring and evaluating the success of P3 approaches
- Case studies using state-of-the-art P3 tools and techniques

For more information please see the [P3HPC workshop website](https://p3hpc.org/workshop/2021/).
Abstract submissions are due August 27.
