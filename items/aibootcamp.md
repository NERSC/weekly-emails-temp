### AI for Science Boot Camp, October 19-20

NERSC, in collaboration with Nvidia, will present a 2-day bootcamp designed to
teach users fundamental concepts and practices in deep learning, and how to
effectively apply them to scientific problems. Participants will learn how to
implement the primary components of deep learning workflows, including hands-on
exercises training and evaluating custom deep-learning models on scientific
datasets.

For more information and to register, please see
