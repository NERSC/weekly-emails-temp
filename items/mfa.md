## Try Multi-Factor Authentication on NERSC Resources!

NERSC encourages you to try Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a new security
feature that can help prevent compromise of user accounts. With MFA, when you
log in you will enter your NIM plassword plus a One-Time-Password (OTP). At
this time, when using MFA at NERSC you will get the OTP via an app (Google
Authenticator) on your smartphone or tablet.

At this time, MFA is available for ssh access to Cori, Edison, Genepool,
Denovo, PDSF, and Data Transfer Nodes. We continue to work on enabling it for
additional services. 

For more information and to get started, please see the MFA web page on the
NERSC website: <https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa/>.
