### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Automated Fortran-C++ Bindings for Large-Scale Scientific Applications, May 12

The May webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Automated Fortran-C++ Bindings for Large-Scale Scientific
Applications",
and will take place Wednesday, May 12, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Seth Johnson (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), 
will present a solution to the challenge of connecting existing Fortran code to
new internal C++ kernels or external C++ libraries, a challenge many developers
interested in performance portability models and other rapidly developing,
dynamic programming paradigms. SWIG-Fortran provides a flexible solution that
includes support for performant data transfers, MPI support, and direct
translation of C++ features to Fortran interfaces.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
