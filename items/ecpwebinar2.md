### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on 55+ Years in HPC: One Woman's Experiences & Perspectives, November 10

The November webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "55+ Years in High-Performance Computing: One Woman's
Experiences and Perspectives"
and will take place **Wednesday, November 10, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

This webinar's format will be different than the others. Jean Shuler (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory) has worked at the leading edge of HPC for 5
decades. This webinar will be a Q&A on the fascinating career of a woman who 
taught herself programming on the job at NASA Langley beginning in 1963, and
found her way to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by 1972, sparking a
long career helping others to find their way in HPC. Jean created and led the
User Services program at NERSC (then housed at LLNL). When NERSC moved to
Berkeley Lab in 1996, Jean applied her passion and experience to support the
ASCI program users at Livermore Computing.

If you yave an interest in computing history, the experiences and impact of
women in computing, or if you are early in your career and looking for 
inspiration, you will want to attend this webinar and listen to Jean's amazing
stories and ask her some questions!
