### BerkeleyGW Events, Week of January 10-14

BerkeleyGW users and other interested parties are invited to attend the 8th
BerkeleyGW Tutorial Workshop and the 3rd Berkeley Excited States Conference,
beginning January 10.

#### The 8th BerkeleyGW Tutorial Workshop

The 8th Annual BerkeleyGW Tutorial workshop will be held online January 10-12.
The workshop will feature hands-on user sessions on the GW and GW-BSE
approaches using the [BerkeleyGW package](http://www.berkeleygw.org/). The
target participants for the workshop include graduate students, postdocs, and 
researchers interested in learning about or sharpening their skills on
*ab initio* calculations of many-electron effects in excited-state properties of
condensed matter.

#### The 3rd Berkeley Excited States Conference (BESC2022) 

On January 13-14, the two-day annual Berkeley Excited States Conference 2022
will also be held online. BESC2022 will be a general topical conference
featuring invited talks by experts on recent progress in the theory and 
applications of *ab initio* study of quantum many-body effects as well as
experiments in excited-state phenomena in materials, showcasing forefront 
research involving advanced many-body approaches, novel experiments, and new
science in the excited state.

#### Registration
