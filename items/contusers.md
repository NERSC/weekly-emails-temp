### Attention Continuing Project PIs & Membership Managers: Mark Continuing Users Before COB Tomorrow!

PIs and others who manage the membership of continuing projects should mark
the users currently in their project who they wish to have continue **before the
end of the day tomorrow** to ensure that they can transition into the new
allocation year without disruption.

If you do not take action, then no users will continue in your project. Jobs in
the queue at the time of the AY transition belonging to non-continuing users
will be deleted.

To take action, please log into [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov) and go to
your project's Roles tab. Click the checkboxes of users you wish to have
continue in your project, and then select "Update all" from the menu to the
right of the user list.

If you miss the deadline, you can add back your users after the AY transition
completes.
