### Project PIs & Membership Managers: Add Back Your Users In Iris

If you were not able to mark continuing users before the Allocation Year
transition last week, it's not too late to add them back into your project.

To take action, please log into [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov) and go to
your project's Roles tab. Click the "From Last Year" button on the right side 
of the member list to view users from last year who are missing from this
year's list. Select the users you want to continue, and click "Add Selected
Users" to add them.
