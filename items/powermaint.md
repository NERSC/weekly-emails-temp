### NERSC Power Outage and Cori Maintenance July 9-12

A 3-yearly power maintenance on the weekend of July 9-12 will
impact Cori and possibly auxiliary NERSC systems. To minimize
interruptions on Cori, the Cori maintenance originally scheduled for
July 21 will be cancelled and instead performed during the July 9-12
power maintenance.

During the morning of Friday July 9 Cori will be shutdown,
including the cscratch1 filesystem, CoriGPU and large memory nodes. We
anticipate that Cori will become available again to users during the
afternoon of Monday July 12.

We aim to keep $HOME and CFS filesystems, HPSS, and auxiliary
services including Iris, Spin, the Data Transfer nodes and Globus
endpoints running with our backup generators. However weather
conditions may necessitate shutting these down too - we'll know closer
to the date how likely we are to face unfavorable weather.

The main NERSC website, docs and help ticket system are hosted
off-site, so should not be impacted.
