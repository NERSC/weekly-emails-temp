### NERSC Power Outage and Cori Maintenance this Friday through Monday!

A 3-yearly **power maintenance this coming weekend**, July 9-12, will impact 
Cori and possibly auxiliary NERSC systems. To minimize interruptions on Cori, 
the Cori maintenance originally scheduled for July 21 has been cancelled and 
the work will instead be performed during this power maintenance.

During the morning of Friday, July 9 Cori will be shut down, including the 
cscratch1 filesystem, CoriGPU, JGI ExVivo nodes, and large memory nodes. We
anticipate that Cori will become available again to users during the afternoon 
of Monday, July 12.

Likewise, we plan to take the **HPSS Archive system down in the morning on
Friday, July 9, and return it to service on Monday, July 12.**

We aim to keep $HOME and CFS filesystems and auxiliary services including Iris, 
Spin, the Data Transfer nodes and Globus endpoints running with our backup 
generators. However, weather conditions may necessitate shutting these down 
too -- we'll know closer to the date how likely we are to face unfavorable 
weather. Be on the lookout for another email later this week with this 
information.

The main NERSC website, docs and help ticket system are hosted off-site, so 
should not be impacted.
