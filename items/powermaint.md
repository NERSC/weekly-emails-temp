### NERSC Power Outage Complete, Systems and Services Back to Nornal

The power maintenance this past weekend was completed slightly ahead of 
schedule, and as of 2:09am PT today (Monday July 12), Cori was back in
normal service. Jupyter returned to service at 8:30am PT and HPSS at 
12:30pm PT. We were able to keep other services running on backup power 
through the weekend, so as of 12:30pm PT today, all NERSC systems and 
services are back up.

Thanks for your patience enabling us to complete this important power 
maintenance work.
