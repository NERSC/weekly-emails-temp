### Nominate Someone for the NERSC Early Career HPC Achievement Awards Today!

Nominations are now open for the 2020 NERSC Early Career High-Performance
Computing Achievement Awards. Awards will be made in the following two
categories:
- **High Impact Scientific Achievement**: recognizing work that has or is 
expected to have an exceptional impact on scientific understanding, engineering 
design for scientific facilities, or a broad societal problem.
- **Innovative Use of High-Performance Computing**: recognizing researchers who
have used NERSC's resources in innovative ways to solve a significant problem or
have provided a new methodology with the potential to have a large scientific
impact. Examples might include application of HPC to a new scientific field or
combining computing, data, networking, and edge services to do something
entirely new in a domain where HPC is already established.

**Eligibility**: The awards recognize scientific research that used NERSC
resources during allocation years 2019 and/or 2020. Any NERSC user who -- at the
time of cited accomplishments -- was a student or had received their degree
during or after 2015 is eligible.

For more information and to nominate someone, please see the [NERSC HPC
Achievement Awards](https://www.nersc.gov/science/nersc-hpc-achievement-awards/)
