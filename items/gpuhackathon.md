### Submit Proposal Before Sunday for July NERSC Online Virtual Hackathon

NERSC, in conjunction with NVIDIA and OLCF, will host a GPU Hackathon in July as
part of NVIDIA's annual [GPU Hackathon Series](https://gpuhackathons.org/)! 
The event will take place online only, with an opening day on July 7 and the
main event from July 13-15, 2020.

This year, the hackathon is going digital. Hack with world-class mentors from
the safety of your home or office!

Teams should consist of three or more developers who are intimately familiar 
with (some part of) their application, and they will work alongside two mentors 
with GPU programming expertise. If you want/need to get your code running (or 
optimized) on a GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer a unique 
opportunity to set aside 4 days, surround yourself with experts in the field, 
and push toward your development goals.  This week's NERSC User News 
[podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/GPU-Hackathons-Kevin-Gott-Interview-edsv5u/a-a25lhon)
is an additional source of information on how the hackathons are organized and
the benefits of participation.

**Please note the deadline to submit a proposal is May 17th, 2020.** If you have
any questions, please feel free to contact Kevin Gott (kngott@lbl.gov).
