### Interested in Julia Language? Take the NERSC Julia Survey!

NERSC is assessing the user community's interest in the Julia language. If you
are using Julia or thinking of using it for future projects -- whether at home, 
your local institution, or at NERSC -- we'd like to hear from you! Please 
complete the 
[NERSC Julia survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefkRXz9PIYM21k1G8Ygkedv7BMzS4ftDeK9TIpBh9j6eDsUA/viewform) 
before September 8,
which will help us improve the Julia user experience at NERSC.
