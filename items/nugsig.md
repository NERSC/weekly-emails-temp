### Next Meeting for NERSC Users Group Special Interest Group on Experimental Facilities this Wednesday!

The next meeting for the NERSC Users Group (NUG) Special Interest Group (SIG) on
Experimental Facilities will be this Wednesday, May 6, at 10 am Pacific time.
David Lawrence will present the NERSC workflow for the Jefferson Lab GlueX
experiment. For more information, including how to connect to the meeting and an
archive of all resources from previous meetings, please see

The inaugural meeting of the SIG on Experimental Facilities was held last month, 
with a discussion of plans and goals for the SIG and a presentation on best 
practices for using NERSC. Outcomes of the meeting included:
- The creation of a web page covering the presented best-practices advice: 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/science-partners/bestpractices-eod/>. (Please note that 
NERSC documentation is hosted from an open 
[git repository](https://gitlab.com/NERSC/nersc.gitlab.io) and contributions 
are encouraged, so please feel free to share your own best practices!)
- A new channel on the NERSC Users Slack workspace, `#user-facilities`, for 
anyone interested in the SIG to join. (See the next entry for information on how
to join the NERSC Users Slack workspace.)

The SIG was formed in order to provide a forum NERSC users who process data from
experimental and observational facilities sponsored by the DOE Office of Science
to exchange best practices, knowledge, and tools. The group will also provide
feedback to NERSC staff on how to improve support for these workflows, and
provide input on policies that affect this growing workload at NERSC. To get
involved please join the channel and take a look at <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/sig-for-experimental-facility-users/> for regular updates.
