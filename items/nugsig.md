### Join Us for the Inaugural NERSC Users Group Special Interest Group on Experimental Facilities Meeting on Wednesday!

The NERSC Users Group (NUG) has formed a new Special Interest Group (SIG) on
Experimental Facilities. The purpose of the SIG is to provide a forum for users
who process data from experimental facilities to discuss policies and tools
that are of specific interest to these users and to advise NERSC on how to
improve its support of these workflows.

The first meeting of the SIG will be this Wednesday, April 22 at 10 am 
(Pacific). The agenda will be:
1. A presentation on best practices and tips for users from experimental
facilities running at NERSC
2. Organizational discussion

To join the meeting, please see <https://www.jlab.org/indico/event/383/>.
