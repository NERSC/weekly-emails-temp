### NERSC Needs Your Input: Take the 1-Minute NERSC Office Hours Survey!

NERSC is planning to hold several sets of office hours (intensive, interactive 
sessions on a given topic with a NERSC expert) for users in the next year. This 
is nothing new -- you may have attended our MFA Office Hours at the end of 
2018/early 2019, KNL office hours in 2019, and the annual ERCAP Office Hours.


What is new? We plan to offer expanded Office Hours topics to help you prepare 
for Perlmutter. But, we need your feedback about which topics are most valuable 
to you. Please let us know what topics you can benefit most from by taking the 
[NERSC Office Hours Topics survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBfd7VYl-Zs-hb-rrgFVfw5msVhfGffvJcjgRat2ag4L3IJw/viewform?usp=sf_link). 
While we can't promise that your favorite topic will be covered, your input will
help us plan our Office Hours schedule in the next year. Please complete the
survey this week!
