### Apply for December NERSC GPU Hackathon by October 8!

NERSC, in conjunction with the OpenACC Organization, NVIDIA and OLCF, will be 
hosting a GPU Hackathon from December 7th-9th with an opening day on December 
1st as part of the annual [GPU Hackathon Series](https://gpuhackathons.org/)!

This year, NERSC is holding two hackathons to help accommodate the great 
interest in our first hackathon, and to prepare the community to run on new and 
upcoming GPU supercomputers, such as Summit, Perlmutter and Frontier.

Accepted teams will be able to use 
[Perlmutter](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/), NERSC's new NVIDIA 
A100-based supercomputer, during the hackathon (outage and maintenance 
permitting).

The hackathon is virtual and we highly encourage Open Science teams that are in 
the process of porting to GPUs to 
[apply](https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/nersc-gpu-hackathon-2021).

Teams should consist of three or more developers who are intimately familiar 
with the relevant parts of their application. They will work alongside mentors 
with GPU programming expertise relevant to their needs. If you want/need to get 
your code running/optimized on a GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer 
a unique opportunity to set aside 4 days, surround yourself with experts in the 
field, and achieve great strides toward your development goals. 

If you are interested in more information, or would like to submit a short 
proposal form, please visit the GPU Hackathon's event page: 
<https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/nersc-december-gpu-hackathon-2021> or 
NERSC's event page: <https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/gpuhackathon-dec2021>.

Please note that the deadline to submit a proposal is **midnight, October 
8th, 2021**. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Kevin Gott 
(<kngott@lbl.gov>).
