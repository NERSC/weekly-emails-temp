Help prepare large-scale scientific codes for next-generation high performance 
computing (HPC) systems.
- [NESAP for Simulations Postdoctoral Fellow](https://jobs.lbl.gov/jobs/nesap-for-simulations-postdoctoral-fellow-2004):
work in multidisciplinary teams to transition simulation codes to NERSC's new 
Perlmutter supercomputer and produce mission-relevant science that truly pushes 
the limits of high-end computing.
- [NESAP for Data Postdoctoral Fellow](https://jobs.lbl.gov/jobs/nesap-for-data-postdoctoral-fellow-2412)
work in multidisciplinary teams to transition data-analysis codes to NERSC's new
Perlmutter supercomputer and produce mission-relevant science that truly pushes 
the limits of high-end computing.
- [NESAP for Learning Postdoctoral Fellow](https://jobs.lbl.gov/jobs/nesap-for-learning-postdoctoral-fellow-1964):
work in multidisciplinary teams to develop and implement cutting-edge machine 
learning/deep learning solutions in codes that will run on NERSC's new
Perlmutter supercomputer and produce mission-relevant science that truly pushes 
the limits of high-end computing.
- [HPC Storage Systems Analyst](https://jobs.lbl.gov/jobs/hpc-storage-systems-analyst-1851):
Help architect, deploy, and manage NERSC's storage hierarchy (including Burst
Buffer, Lustre, and Spectrum Scale filesystems, and HPSS archives).
