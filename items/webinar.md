### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 16 September, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our September meeting is **this Thursday, 16 September, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. Our topic-of-the-month is 
**ERCAP**. We are now accepting ERCAP submissions for AY2022, so Clayton 
Bagwell, who coordinates the allocations process at NERSC, will talk about 
the process and present some tips for submitting your ERCAP request. 

Our agenda for September is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** **ERCAP**. Clayton
  Bagwell, who coordinates the allocations process at NERSC, will talk about
  the process and present some tips for submitting your ERCAP request.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
