### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 19 August, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our August meeting is **this Thursday, 19 August, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. Our topic-of-the-month is 
**NUGEX** - we'll talk about what NUGEX does, and how you can participate.

Our agenda for August is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** **NUGEX**. We'll talk about what NUGEX does, and 
  how you can participate.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
