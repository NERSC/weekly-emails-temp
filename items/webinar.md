### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 20 May, 11am PT

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our May meeting is **this Thursday, 20 May, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>, and out topic of the month 
will be **Running on GPUs at NERSC: job scripts for CoriGPU** - 
bring a job script to show or ask about - or just come to see some 
examples of scripts others are using - and join the discussion!

Our agenda for May is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic is **Running on GPUs at NERSC: 
  job scripts for CoriGPU**. A few NESAP project members will walk us 
  through their CoriGPU job scripts to show how they are using GPUs and 
  the settings that enable it. If you haven't run a GPU job yet, come 
  along for examples to get you started, and if you have, bring a script 
  to either give or ask tips from the NERSC use community.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
