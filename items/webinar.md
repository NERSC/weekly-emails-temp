### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 18 March, 11am PT

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our February
meeting is **this Thursday, 18 March, at 11am** (Pacific time), at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.
  - Today we'll talk a bit about the Allocation Year transition, scheduled for 
    January 20, 2021, and what you can expect for next year.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic topic is "**Parallelware tools for 
  detecting code optimization opportunities**". Manuel Arenaz and Javier Novo 
  Rodr√≠guez from Appentra will demonstrate using Parallelware Trainer and
  Analyzer tools to parallelize the Canny edge detector image processing 
  algorithm, using multithreading, SIMD and offloading. These tools are 
  available on Cori via `module load pwtrainer` and `module load pwanalyzer`, 
  and release notes for the latest versions are at 
  <https://www.appentra.com/parallelware-trainer-1-6-released/> and 
  <https://www.appentra.com/parallelware-analyzer-0-17-released/>.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent month.
