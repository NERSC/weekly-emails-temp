### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 19 November, 11am PT

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our October
meeting is **this Thursday, 19 November, at 11am** (Pacific time), at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.

- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.

- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.

- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic topic is "NERSC and NERSC
  Users at SC20". This week and last week NERSC staff and many users
  have participated in SC20, the largest annual Supercomputing conference.
  We'll run through some highlights, have an open discussion of what our
  users found interesting and build up a list of topics and talks of
  interest to the NERSC user community.

- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?

- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent month.
