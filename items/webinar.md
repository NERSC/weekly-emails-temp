### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 15 April, 11am PT

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our April
meeting is **this Thursday, 15 April, at 11am** (Pacific time), at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic is tentatively a **showcase of
  SummitVR**, a DOE-supported effort to develop a collaborative VR data
  visualization platform. NERSC user Simon Woodruff will demonstrate the tool 
  and talk about how it can be used in DOE projects.
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.
