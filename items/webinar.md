### Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 24 September, 11am PT

We're re-launching the NUG Monthly Webinar with a more interactive format,
starting this Thursday, 24 September, at 11am, at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.

- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.

- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.

- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month we'll talk about **"PSPS season, and what 
  you can do about it"**. Last year we were alerted by PG&E for three 
  potential PSPS events, and lost power in two of them. 

  We don't always get a lot of notice, so long-running jobs are at risk 
  of being terminated before they finish. One good solution is to use
  checkpointing to break your job into shorter spans. **Zhengji Zhao** from 
  NERSC User Engagement Group will give some tips on checkpointing at 
  NERSC, and then we'll have a **Q&A session about PSPS readiness** with 
  **Zhengji**, NERSC Deputy of Operations **Jeff Broughton** and **Rebecca 
  Hartman-Baker**, who leads the NERSC team that ensures our users are 
  kept updated during such events.

- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics 

- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent month
