### (NEW) Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 15 October, 11am PT

The NUG Monthly Webinar is now the NUG Monthly Meeting with a more 
interactive format, on the third Thursday of every month. Our October
meeting is this Thursday, 15 October, at 11am, at 
<https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>.

Our aim for these meetings is for a forum where NERSC and its users can 
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 
We'll follow the structure described below; please come along and join the
discussion!

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.

- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.

- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events.

- **Topic-of-the-day:** This month's topic is "The cscratch1 crash and
  Lustre file striping". Cori had a major outage during the last two
  weeks. We're still investigating the root cause but the trigger
  conditions appear to relate to files with a very large stripe count.
  We'll give a brief overview of the crash and then talk a bit about
  Lustre File Striping and how to choose a good setting, and some Q&A,
  with NERSC's Doug Jacobsen (Computational Systems Group), Glenn
  Lockwood (Storage Systems Group) and Lisa Gerhardt and Alberto
  Chiusole (Data and Analytics Services).

  We'll do a deeper debrief on the crash in a later meeting - currently
  we are still investigating the root cause. But we can say a little about
  what we have found, and how to get the most from Lustre cscratch1
  without risking stability.

- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics 

- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent month
