### Consulting & Account Support Holidays Thursday through January 1

The Berkeley Lab holiday shutdown begins this Thursday, December 24, and goes 
through Friday, January 1, 2021. For the majority of this period, consulting
and account support services will be unavailable. Limited account support and
consulting services will be available December 29-30, but for the remainder of
the holiday, no consulting or account support will be available. Operations
staff will be onsite for the duration of the period, but we request that you
limit your contact with them to only the most urgent queries.

Regular consulting and account support will resume on Monday, January 4, 2021.
