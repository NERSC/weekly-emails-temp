### Perlmutter Availability Access Plan

NERSC is continuing to configure and test Perlmutter in preparation for opening
the system to the broader NERSC community. We are working with a small number
of application partners to identify issues and test the programming and runtime
environments. 

Once the system is ready, users will be added in stages beginning with 
early-access users.
