### Perlmutter Availability Access Plan

Perlmutter is currently unavailable to users. We do not have a set date for
allowing the first wave of users onto the machine, but when the machine is
suitable for its first users, we will add users in stages. The order of access 
is outlined at <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/#access>. If your
team wishes to join an earlier access tier, please fill out the 
[survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RlEP_9Ofz7k_KDBw7ojG6Mr51wQPQExJn5fSbTvpXuk) 
sent last week, before the June 30 deadline.
