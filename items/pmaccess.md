### Perlmutter Availability Access Plan

Perlmutter is currently unavailable to users. We do not have a set date for
allowing the first wave of users onto the machine, but when the machine is
suitable for its first users, we will add users in stages. The order of access 
is outlined at <https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/#access>. We are 
currently evaluating user submissions to determine the list of teams to be let
onto the machine in earlier tiers.
