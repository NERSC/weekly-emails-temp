### Interactive HPC 2020

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent HPC-based 
workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.  The real-time 
QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and observational data 
workloads.  Jupyter has become a major point of entry and platform for interactive 
ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd like to 
share with the world?  Then please consider submitting a paper to the Fourth 
Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020.  Position 
papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome (up to 10 
pages).  The workshop itself will be held November 15 or 16, in conjunction with 
SuperComputing 2020.  The exact date and location are TBD since the event may be 
virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  More details on the workshop and submission 
instructions are at: https://www.interactivehpc.com/
