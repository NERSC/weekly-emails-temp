## Sitewide Power Outage and Cori Maintenance (OS Upgrade), July 26-30

### Power Outage Over the Weekend

To complete the power upgrades required for Perlmutter, the power entering Shyh
Wang Hall (where NERSC is housed) must be shut down while new equipment is
installed. The work is expected to take two days, over the last weekend in July.

We plan to shut down all NERSC resources beginning on Friday, July 26, in 
preparation for the weekend power work. Power will be restored on or before
Monday, July 29, at which point we will begin a maintenance on Cori.

### Cori Maintenance: Operating System Upgrade

The operating system (OS) on Cori will be upgraded from CLE6.0UP07 to 
CLE7.0UP00, which is a **major version upgrade** that includes upgrading the 
kernel from SLES12 to SLES15. Thus, **rebuilding your software is required.** 
NERSC is also preparing to rebuild the software we support so that the most 
important software for users is available after the OS upgrade.

Due to the change in the operating system, we have learned that all Cray 
software versions older than CDT/19.03 will no longer work.
