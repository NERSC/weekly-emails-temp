## OpenMP Common Core training Next Monday <a name="omp"/> ##

OpenMP is a large and complicated standard, but most OpenMP programs need only 16 items from 
the specification, known as the OpenMP Common Core. On Monday, February 5, NERSC will hold a 
hands-on tutorial on the OpenMP Common Core, which will help attendees to master the common core 
and use OpenMP in their own projects. 

The tutorial can be attended in person (recommended for better access to hands-on exercises) or 
remotely via Zoom. For more information and to register, please see
