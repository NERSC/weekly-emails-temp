## OpenMP Training: Beyond the Common Core May 4 ##

Tim Mattson from Intel and Helen He from NERSC will present a full day of 
intermediate-level OpenMP training at NERSC on May 4. 

Programmers may spend their entire OpenMP programming careers safely inside the
common core. Well rounded OpenMP programmers, however, should be aware of what
lays just beyond the common core. These less common features of OpenMP were
included in the language for a good reason and only by understanding them at a
high level can you know when you might need them. In this **hands-on tutorial**, you
will gain experience working outside the common core. We won't cover every
single feature beyond the common core, but we will survey them with enough
breadth so following this tutorial, you will be able to pick up and work with
what you need.

The tutorial is being help in Building 59, Room 3101. For registration and Zoom
