## OpenMP Common Core training **today** Feb 5 ##

OpenMP is a large and complicated standard, but most OpenMP programs need only 
16 items from the specification, known as the OpenMP Common Core. **Today**, 
Monday, February 5, NERSC is holding a hands-on tutorial on the OpenMP Common 
Core, which will help attendees to master the common core and use OpenMP in 
their own projects. 

The tutorial can be attended in person or remotely via Zoom. We recommend
in-person for better access to hands-on exercises, and there are still 
places available if you are at the lab and do not need a visitor pass. 

The tutorial is being help in Building 59, Room 4102. For registration 
and Zoom connection details please see
