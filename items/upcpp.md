### Register Now for UPC++ Webinar on May 27

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this webinar, hosted by DOE's Exascale Computing Project and the ALCF, we 
will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization techniques of UPC++. We 
will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and walk through basic 
algorithm implementations. We will also look at irregular applications and show 
how they can take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize their performance.

This training will be held on May 27 from 9 am to noon Pacific.
The training is free but registration is required. For more information and to
