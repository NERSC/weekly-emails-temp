### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Software Design for Longevity with Performance Portability on December 9

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Software Design for Longevity with Performance Portability"
and will take place this Wednesday, December 9, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Anshu Dubey (Argonne National Laboratory), will
discuss the challenges of designing software that reconciles the cross purposes
of performance portability and longevity, and present a few basic principles of 
scientific software design that have been instrumental in mitigating some of the
challenges that application developers are facing. These principles represent a
combination of experience from the presenter's own project and from the ECP
Performance Portability panel series over the summer.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
