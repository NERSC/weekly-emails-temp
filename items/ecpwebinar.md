Them and How Each of Us Can Help Them Thrive"
and will take place this **Wednesday, December 8, 2021, at 10:00 am

complexity: embracing community collaboration toward scientific software
ecosystems while fostering a diverse HPC workforce embodying a broad range of
skills and perspectives. The webinar will introduce work in the ECP such as the
E4S project, as well as cross-cutting strategies to increase developer 
productivity and software sustainability, thereby mitigating technical risks by
building a firmer foundation for reproducible, sustainable science, and
complementary community efforts and opportunities for involvement.
