### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Mining Development Data to Understand and Improve Software Engineering Processes on Wednesday

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Mining Development Data to Understand and Improve Software 
Engineering Processes in HPC Projects",
and will take place **this Wednesday, July 7, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

This webinar, presented by Boyana Norris (University of Oregon), will explore
the role of software-related data mining tools in supporting productive
development of high-performance scientific software. The discussion will include
a variety of existing and emerging tools for analyzing code, git, emails, 
issues, test results, and dependencies, with the long-term goal of improving the
understanding of development processes and enhancing developer productivity.
Specific analysis examples of a subset of these tools applied to ECP projects
will be included.
