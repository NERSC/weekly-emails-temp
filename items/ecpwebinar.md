### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Reducing Technical Debt with Reproducible Containers on Wednesday

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Reducing Technical Debt with Reproducible Containers"
and will take place this Wednesday, November 4, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Tanu Malik (DePaul University), will describe 
different levels of technical debt and quantify their costs; introduce
isolation in containers as a powerful mechanism for reducing portability debt;
provide a vision of a reproducible container with the aim of repaying different
technical debt types; and conclude with results of using reproducible containers
on domain science and HPC use cases, and provide guidance.
