### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on "Lessons Learned & Possibilities for Using the 'Wrong' Programming Approach on Leadership Computing Facility Systems," January 12

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Wrong Way: Lessons Learned and Possibilities for
Using the 'Wrong' Programming Approach on Leadership Computing Facility
Systems,"
and will take place **Wednesday, January 12, 2022, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

In this webinar, Philip C. Roth (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
will discuss the impact of using a "wrong" programming approach for a given
system, in the context of the accelerated large-scale computing systems deployed
and being deployed at US Department of Energy Computing facilities. In this
webinar, he will present a few of these "wrong" programming approaches, and
lessons learned in cases where the approach has been attempted.
