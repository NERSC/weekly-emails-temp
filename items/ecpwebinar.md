### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Accelerating Numerical Libraries with Multi-Precision Algorithms on May 13

The May webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Accelerating Numerical Software Libraries with Multi-Precision
algorithms", and will take place next Wednesday, May 13, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Hartwig Anzt (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) and
Piotr Luszczek (University of Tennessee), will explain how low-precision,
high-speed special function units in modern processors can be leveraged to
create fast numerical libraries for production computing.
