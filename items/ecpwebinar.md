### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Migrating to Heterogeneous Computing on October 13 

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Migrating to Heterogeneous Computing: Lessons Learned in the
Sierra and El Capitan Centers of Excellence"
and will take place **Wednesday, October 13, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

In this webinar, David Richards (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)
describes the role of the Sierra Center of Excellence in bringing experts from 
IBM and NVIDIA together with LLNL in a concentrated effort to prepare 
applications, system software, and tools for the Sierra supercomputer. A new COE
for preparing for El Capitan is underway with HPE and AMD. The speaker will 
describe the operation of these COEs and share lessons learned, with the hope
that others will be able to learn from both their successes and intermediate
setbacks.
