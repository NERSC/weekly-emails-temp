### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Leading Open Source Projects on Wednesday! 

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "What I learned from 20 Years of Leading Open Source
Projects"
and will take place **this Wednesday, September 15, 2021, at 11:00 am 
Pacific time (note one hour later than usual).**

In this webinar, Wolfgang Bangerth (Colorado State University) shares lessons
learned about both the technical management of scientific software projects and
the social side of these projects. Scientific software has grown from loose 
collections of individual routines working on relatively simple data structures 
to very large packages of 100,000s to millions of lines of code, with dozens of 
contributors, and hundreds or thousands of users. In the process, the 
approaches to software development have also drastically changed: both the 
software packages as well as their development are professionally managed, with 
version control, extensive test suites, and automatic regression checks for 
every patch. Maybe more interestingly, the approaches to managing the 
*community* of software developers and users have also dramatically changed.
