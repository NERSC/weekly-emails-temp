### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Testing & Code Review Practices in Research Software Development on Wednesday 

The September webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Testing and Code Review Practices in Research Software 
Development" and will take place this Wednesday, September 9, 2020, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by Nasir Eisty (California Polytechnic State University,
San Luis Obispo), will cover the use of two software quality practices in the
development of research software: software testing and peer code review. These
practices can lead to not only improved scientific results through higher 
quality software in the short term, but also more maintainable software in the 
long term. Learn about the challenges, barriers, and necessary improvements to
make the practices effective for research software development, based on studies
of the research software community conducted via interviews, surveys, workshops,
and tutorials.

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
