### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Scientific Software Ecosystems & Communities, December 8

The next webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "Scientific Software Ecosystems and Communities: Why We Need
Them and How Each of Us Can Help Them Thrive"
and will take place **Wednesday, December 8, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

In this webinar, Lois Curfman McInnes (Argonne National Laboratory)
will discuss a means of tackling the increasing challenges of software
complexity: embracing community collaboration toward scientific software
ecosystems while fostering a diverse HPC workforce embodying a broad range of
skills and perspectives. The webinar will introduce work in the ECP such as the
E4S project, as well as cross-cutting strategies to increase developer 
productivity and software sustainability, thereby mitigating technical risks by
building a firmer foundation for reproducible, sustainable science, and
complementary community efforts and opportunities for involvement.
