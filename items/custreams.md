### CUDA Multi Process Service, August 17

As a continuation of last year's popular 
[CUDA Training Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/),
NVIDIA will present a session on "CUDA Multi Process Service" to NERSC and
OLCF users on Tuesday, August 17, 2021, from 10 am to noon (Pacific time).

CUDA allows the user to target a GPU with multiple processes. A common use case
in HPC is using multiple MPI ranks to target the same GPU. This session will
describe how NVIDIA GPUs work when targeted by multiple processes
simultaneously, and present the CUDA multi-process service (MPS) which helps
improve the scheduling efficiency of this use case. The multi-instance GPU
(MIG) feature on the NVIDIA A100 GPU will also be discussed, and the difference
between MPS and MIG (and when you would use one or the other) will be
explained.

After the presentation, there will be a hands-on session where participants can
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts and
observe their impact on application performance. Cori-GPU access will be
provided for current NERSC users for the hands-on exercises. Temporary OLCF
Summit access will not be available for remote participants.

Registration is required for remote participation. For more information and to
register please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-multi-process-service-aug-2021/>.

An additional session is also scheduled for 
[CUDA Debugging](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-debugging-sep-2021/)
on September 14
