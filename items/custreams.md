### CUDA Multithreading with Streams Training, July 16

As a continuation of last year's popular 
[CUDA Training Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/),
NVIDIA will present a session on "CUDA Multithreading with Streams" to NERSC and
OLCF users next Friday, July 16, 2021, from 10 am to noon (Pacific time).

CUDA streams are useful for achieving concurrency and ensuring an application is
fully utilizing the GPU. However, many GPU-accelearated applications start off
as multi-threaded CPU applications. In this module, we will explore the
combination of GPU concurrency and a multi-threaded context, such as an OpenMP
application. Following the presentation there will be a hands-on session for
participants to complete example exercises to observe the impact of changes on
application performance. NERSC will provide access to its Cori-GPU system for
current NERSC users.

Registration is required for remote participation. For more information and to
register please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-multithreading-with-streams-july-16-2021/>.

Additional sessions in the series are scheduled:

August 17
- [CUDA Debugging](https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cuda-debugging-sep-2021/), September 14
