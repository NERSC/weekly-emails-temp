### Update to NERSC Ticketing System Tomorrow Afternoon

NERSC will be updating its ticketing system to the latest software stack
tomorrow, Tuesday, March 24. The maintenance will take place from 1-5 pm 
(Pacific). For approximately one hour during this period, 
<https://help.nersc.gov> will not be accessible. Tickets submitted by email will
be held in a queue during the downtime.

If you have bookmarked the ServiceNow URL to which help.nersc.gov resolves, that
URL will change to <https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/> after the 
maintenance.
