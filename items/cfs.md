## New Community File System Now Available

The new "Community" File System (CFS) has replaced the Project file system in
the new allocation year (AY). It was made available via a rolling reboot that
completed last week.

Each active project has a directory on CFS with the path structure
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<repo_name>`, but existing 
`/global/project/projectdirs/<repo_name>` paths will redirect to the
corresponding CFS path until mid-2020.
