### New Community File System Now Available

The new "Community" File System (CFS) has replaced the Project file system in
this allocation year (AY). 
Each active project has a directory on CFS with the path structure
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<repo_name>`, but existing 
`/global/project/projectdirs/<repo_name>` paths will redirect to the
corresponding CFS path until mid-2020.

**Please update the paths in your scripts** to use `/global/cfs/cdirs/` instead of 
`/project /projectdirs/` or `/global/project/projectdirs` at your earliest 
convenience!
