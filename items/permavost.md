### Submissions Due Wednesday: PERMAVOST 2021 Workshop on Performance Engineering, Modelling, Analysis, & Visualization Strategy

The Workshop on Performance EngineeRing, Modelling, Analysis, and VisualizatiOn
STrategy (PERMAVOST), to be held June 25, 2021 in conjunction with ACM 
HPDC 2021, has opened its call for participation.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together tools developers and end users of
performance analysis tools. Topics of interest include
- Performance analysis and modelling of real-world applications;
- Data visualization in high-level performance analysis;
- Inefficiencies in programming patterns or computing architectures;
- Patterns, anomaly detection, and performance characterization in HPC applications;
- Performance engineering strategies and use cases;
- Analyzing application performance in cloud environments and other ubiquitous technologies;
- Machine-learning-aided performance analysis.
