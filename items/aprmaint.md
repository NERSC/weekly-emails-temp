### April Cori Maintenance Planned to Begin Evening of April 21

The April monthly maintenance includes a Cori scratch file system check that was
rescheduled from March. The file system check is a lengthy process so instead of
starting the maintenance on Wednesday morning as usual, we will begin at 10:00 
pm (Pacific time) on Tuesday, April 21. At that time, Cori and the Cori scratch 
system will become unavailable to users. We expect that the maintenance will be 
complete and all systems returned to users by 11:59 pm on April 22.
