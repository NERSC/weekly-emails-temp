## Submit Your Science Using NERSC to the APS March Meeting's (pre)-Exascale Science Session before Friday

NERSC, ALCF, and OLCF are co-sponsoring a focus topic session entitled
"Building the Bridge to Exascale: Applications and Opportunities for Materials,
Chemistry, and Biology" (DCOMP 16.01.02) at the 2019 Annual March Meeting of 
the American Physical Society. This is an opportunity to present your 
breakthrough accomplishments that were enabled through the use of pre-exascale 
computing systems.

This focus session will bring together researchers with experience in the 
effective utilization of high-performance data and compute infrastructure, 
including supercomputers, communication networks, and data resources to achieve 
breakthrough scientific results. This includes researchers at experimental 
facilities such as light and neutron sources with extreme data-science 
requirements, including machine-learning approaches, and researchers in 
computational materials, computational chemistry and computational biophysics 
with experience in large scale simulations. Also of interest software 
development efforts which will enable novel science on pre-exascale and emerging
architectures.

The abstract submission deadline is this Friday, October 26, 2018. Abstracts can
be submitted through the American Physics Society March Meeting website:
