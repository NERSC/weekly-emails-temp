### Sign up for Training on HPC Toolkit on March 29 & April 2!

The developers of HPCToolkit from Rice University will present a 2-part training
series on using HPCToolkit to measure and analyze the performance of 
GPU-accelerated applications. This tutorial will (1) introduce HPCToolkit's 
general capabilities for performance measurement and analysis, (2) highlight new
capabilities for performance measurement and analysis of GPU-accelerated codes, 
(3) contrast HPCToolkit's capabilities with those of other tools, (4) describe 
how to use HPCToolkit's user interfaces effectively, and (5) describe how to use
HPCToolkit to analyze GPU-accelerated applications on platforms with NVIDIA 
GPUs. Cori GPU nodes will be available to NERSC users for the hands-on 
exercises. 

The first three-hour session on March 29 will consist of presentations and demos
of using HPCToolkit, and the second three-hour session on April 2 will consist
of demos and help for users to apply HPCToolkit to their own codes.
