### Learn Performance-Portable Kokkos in Kokkos Lecture Series, Starting July 17

Kokkos is a C++ programming model for performance portability that allows 
developers to implement their applications in a single-source fashion, with
hardware vendor-agnostic programming patterns.

If you've been curious about how to write code with Kokkos, now is your chance!
The Kokkos team is providing its first **Kokkos Lecture Series**, to be held on
Fridays starting July 17 through early September, where attendees learn 
everything necessary to start using Kokkos to write performance-portable code. 
The series consists of a two-hour online lecture every Friday and exercises as 
homework. The team will provide support via GitHub and Slack throughout the 
series.

The series begins on Friday, July 17. **There are a limited number of seats
available, so registration is recommended.** (Please note that although this is 
an ECP-sponsored training, registration is open to all.) For more information
