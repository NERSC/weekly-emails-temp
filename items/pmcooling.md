### Reduction in Perlmutter Node Availability during Cooling System Physical Maintenance

The Perlmutter Phase 1 system, which is currently in its early user 
pre-production stage, requires physical maintenance of the cooling system that 
will take up to 6 weeks to complete. Rather than shut down the entire machine, 
NERSC will perform the maintenance in a rolling fashion with the aim of 
keeping 500 or more nodes available to users. Occasionally, some jobs may see 
decreased GPU performance during this time. We will try to keep as much of the 
system available as possible, but please understand that Perlmutter is not yet 
a production resource with any uptime guarantees.
