## ERCAP Submissions Due Monday, October 7 <a name="ercap"/> ##

Submissions for the 2020 ERCAP allocations process are now open. Requests
will be accepted through Monday, October 7. During September and October, NERSC
will hold [ERCAP Office Hours](#ercapoffichrs) via Zoom to assist users with 
submitting their requests.

Please listen to this NERSC User News [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/ERCAP-Allocation-Requests-Clayton-Bagwell-Interview-e4u09l)
for more information about ERCAP.


## Applications for Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program Now Open <a name="bssw"/> ##

Do you have something to share with the scientific software community? Do you
have a passion to learn and teach others about better software? Are you 
affiliated with a US-based institution that can receive funding from the US
Department of Energy? If so, consider applying for a Better Scientific Software
(BSSw) Fellowship. Fellows receive an award of up to $25,000 that can be used
for an activity that promotes better scientific software, such as organizing a
workshop or tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software
community.

For more information and to apply, please see <https://bssw.io/fellowship>.
Applications are due Tuesday, October 15. 


## Appentra Parallelware Tool Training on October 17! <a name="parallelware"/> ##

NERSC is always looking for new ways to improve user experience while coding.
One ever-present challenge in high-performance computing is how to parallelize 
your code to improve on-node or offload performance. Many users struggle with
getting this right. Fortunately, Appentra has developed the 
[Parallelware](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/) Trainer
Tool to teach you!

NERSC has partnered with Appentra to offer a one-day training for users to try 
this new tool. This training, which will be taught by Appentra founder Manuel 
Arneaz, will be offered on Thursday, October 17 at NERSC. It will begin with an 
overview of the tool and how to use it, and continue with a hands-on session for
the remainder of the day.

Registration information and agenda for the day are forthcoming.


## Sign up Now for UPC++ Workshop on November 1 at NERSC! <a name="upcpp"/> ##

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support 
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms 
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through 
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous 
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing 
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or 
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to 
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this tutorial we will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization 
techniques of UPC++. We will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and 
walk through implementing basic algorithms in UPC++. We will also look at 
irregular applications and how to take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize 
their performance.

This event can be attended on-site at NERSC or remotely via Zoom. The remote 
connection information will be provided to the registrants closer to the event. 
[Registration](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/upc/) is required for this 
event and space is limited so please register as soon as possible. Registration 
closes when the limit is reached or on October 18, 2019.


## Videos from June New Users Training Now Available <a name="newuservideos"/> ##
