## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Holiday Today; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="mlkday"/></a> 

Consulting and account support will be unavailable **today**, January 17, due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. Regular 
consulting and account support services will resume tomorrow. 


### (NEW) Attention Continuing Project PIs & Membership Managers: Mark Continuing Users Before COB Tomorrow! <a name="contusers"/></a> 

PIs and others who manage the membership of continuing projects should mark
the users currently in their project who they wish to have continue **before the
end of the day tomorrow** to ensure that they can transition into the new
allocation year without disruption.

If you do not take action, then no users will continue in your project. Jobs in
the queue at the time of the AY transition belonging to non-continuing users
will be deleted.

To take action, please log into [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov) and go to
your project's Roles tab. Click the checkboxes of users you wish to have
continue in your project, and then select "Update all" from the menu to the
right of the user list.

If you miss the deadline, you can add back your users after the AY transition
completes.


### Allocation Year 2021 to 2022 Transition this Wednesday, January 19 <a name="aytransition"/></a> 

The current Allocation Year (AY21) ends at 7 am Pacific Time **this Wednesday,
January 19, 2022**.

PIs for new and continuing projects have received notification of the status of 
their project request. Project PIs/Proxies/Membership managers for continuing
projects should 
[select their continuing users](https://docs.nersc.gov/iris/iris-for-pis/#set-your-user-list-for-the-next-allocation-year) 
**before close of business tomorrow**. This can be performed in
the project's "Roles" tab. Note that the "alert" triangle will continue to 
appear at the top of the Iris webpage even if you have completed this task, 
until the new allocation year.

There are a few changes for AY22. Of note:
- **Charge factors have been recalibrated to the new Perlmutter machine.** The 
new currency, "CPU Node Hours", are 1/400th the size of the former "NERSC Hours"
currency. Using one hour of time on a Cori Haswell node will cost 0.34 CPU Node
Hours, and one hour of time on a Cori KNL will cost 0.2 CPU Node Hours. When we
begin charging for Perlmutter (which will likely happen for the second half of
the year), the charge for a single Perlmutter CPU node for one hour will be 1.0.
- **Two separate allocations for CPU and GPU architectures.** Projects will have
allocations on CPU and GPU architectures, which are separate and cannot be
traded or exchanged.
- **New default Python Module at AY Transition.** Please see the 
[entry](#python) on this topic below.
- **Cori defaults will change in March, 2022.** Cori defaults will remain the
same at the AY transition, but the machine will undergo what we hope will be its
final major system upgrade during the March maintenance, at which time the
default user environment will be updated.

For more information, please see the 
[Allocation Year Transition](https://www.nersc.gov/news-publications/announcements/allocation-year-transition-2021-to-2022) 
page.


### Join the "Julia at NERSC" Call on Friday! <a name="julia"/></a> 

NERSC will host a "Julia at NERSC" call on Friday, January 21 from 12:30 to
1:30 pm (Pacific time) on Zoom 
([link to meeting](https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/97357505996?pwd=dm5aUkpPVk8rN3R1RHR1K0YxMUZsQT09)).

The agenda includes
1. Future Julia support at NERSC (what we have planned, and what you would like
to see)
2. Community involvement in Julia support at NERSC (e.g., documented use cases,
design patterns, etc.)
3. Planning future meetings (format, frequency, etc.)
4. Any other business

All NERSC users are welcome to attend. Please also let us know if you would like
to make any additions to the agenda. This meeting will also explore future
Julia at NERSC calls, so please bring your ideas about interesting topics for
future discussions.

To stay up to date on all the latest Julia at NERSC info, please subscribe to
the [Julia at NERSC calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19uYzVsMTAwcjc1NW9xNzh2a3BsMXUxaXRrc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
running user jobs. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive 
early this year. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken
out of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up 
to 8 weeks. We are developing a plan for integration that will reduce the
amount of time the entire system is down. We will let you know when this plan is
finalized.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Prepare Your Dotfiles for Perlmutter! <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

To help ready your account for Perlmutter, please review your dotfiles. The same
home file system is mounted across all NERSC systems, so your 
`.bashrc`/`.cshrc`/etc. files (dotfiles) need to work on all systems. The
NERSC\_HOST variable can help you distinguish between systems and to set 
customizations for each system. The NERSC\_HOST variable is set automatically to
"perlmutter" on Perlmutter and to "cori" on Cori. 

Some users may have older dot files that are setting the NERSC\_HOST variable 
without first checking to see whether it already has a value, which will cause
problems on Perlmutter. Please ensure that this is not the case in your
dotfiles. Feel free to reach out to [NERSC consulting](https://help.nersc.gov)
with any questions or issues.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### New Default Python module at AY transition; All Python modules will support conda activate <a name="python"/></a> 

Python users take note: On Jan 19, 2022 at the Allocation Year rollover, NERSC 
will change our default Python and Python3 modules on Cori to 
python/3.9-anaconda-2021.11. Please note that older Python modules will remain 
available, but users must specify the full module name to continue to use them.

[Updates](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/reference/release-notes/#anaconda-2021-11-nov-17-2021) 
in this module include:
- Python 3.9
- Support for conda activate
- Mamba 0.7.6 (a faster alternative to conda)
- netcdf4 1.5.8
- mpi4py 3.1.3
- authlib 0.15.4 (support for NERSC's [Superfacility API](https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/sfapi/))

This module is available via `module load python/3.9-anaconda-2021.11`, and
we encourage you to test it now.

At the AY transition, we will retroactively change the behavior of **all**
Cori Python modules to support `conda activate`. Please see
[these pending updates to our documentation](https://gitlab.com/NERSC/nersc.gitlab.io/-/merge_requests/1665)
for more details. As always, if you have a question, please contact us via
our [helpdesk](https://help.nersc.gov).

**Note for pip users:** pip packages installed via `--user` will be 
installed at `$HOME/.local/cori/3.9-anaconda-2021.11` (defined by 
`$PYTHONUSERBASE`).

Note that the python/3.9-anaconda-2021.11 module is already the default on
Perlmutter and `conda activate` functionality is already supported there. There 
are no scheduled Python module changes on Perlmutter. 


### NERSC Federated Identity Pilot Has Begun! <a name="fedid"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab staff can now follow a
one-time process to link their Lab identity to their NERSC identity, then
subsequently use their Lab credentials to log into resources such as Iris,
ServiceNow, and the NERSC web site.

We anticipate that soon, more than two-thirds of our users
will be able to use their institutional login credentials to log into
these NERSC services.

**The appearance of the NERSC login page for these services has now changed**: 
instead of the form requesting your login name and password you will
see a menu where you can choose the institution to use for login.

During this first phase, if you are not Berkeley Lab staff, simply select
"NERSC" as the authentication source, and you will be sent to the
familiar NERSC authentication form. If you are Lab staff, we encourage you 
to select the "Berkeley Lab" option and try it out!
