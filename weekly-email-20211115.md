## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### (NEW) Annual User Survey Begins Tomorrow! <a name="usersurvey"/></a> 

NERSC has engaged a professional survey company, the National Business Research
Institute (NBRI), to conduct our annual user survey. Users can **expect an email
from <NERSC@nbriresearch.com> in their inboxes tomorrow**, with a personalized
link to the user survey.

We value your response to the survey, which helps inform future plans for
improvements to benefit our users. Please take the survey to let us know what 
we've done well and how we can better serve you!


### (NEW) Join Us for the NUG Meeting, this Thursday 18 November, 11am PT <a name="webinar"/></a> 

The NUG monthly meeting is a forum where NERSC and its users can
celebrate successes, discuss difficulties and learn from each other. 

Our September meeting is **this Thursday, 18 November, at 11am** (Pacific time),
at <https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/285479463>. Our topic-of-the-month is 
**Spack at NERSC**. NERSC provides a "spack" module that you can use 
to install specific software in your `$HOME` or 
`/global/common/software/<myproject>` area, and today we will walk 
through how you can use it.

Our agenda for November is:

- **Win-of-the-month:** open discussion for attendees to tell of some 
  success you've had - e.g., getting a paper accepted, solving a problem, 
  or acheiving something innovative or high impact using NERSC.
- **Today-I-learned:** open discussion for attendees to point out something 
  that surprised them, or that might be valuable to other users to know.
- **Announcements and CFPs:** upcoming conferences, workshops, or other events
  that you think might interest or benefit the NERSC user community.
- **Topic-of-the-day:** **Spack at NERSC**. We'll walk through the essentials 
  of using the available `spack` module to install software 
- **Coming up:** Nominations and requests for future topics. We're
  especially interested to hear from our users - what are you using
  NERSC for, and what are you learning that might be helpful for other
  NERSC users, and for NERSC?
- **Last month's numbers:** NERSC center metrics and info for the most recent 
  month.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-meeting-18-nov-2021/>
for details.

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive in
early 2022. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken out
of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up to 8 
weeks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Prepare Your Dotfiles for Perlmutter! <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

To help ready your account for Perlmutter, please review your dotfiles. The same
home file system is mounted across all NERSC systems, so your 
`.bashrc`/`.cshrc`/etc. files (dotfiles) need to work on all systems. The
NERSC\_HOST variable can help you distinguish between systems and to set 
customizations for each system. The NERSC\_HOST variable is set automatically to
"perlmutter" on Perlmutter and to "cori" on Cori. 

Some users may have older dot files that are setting the NERSC\_HOST variable 
without first checking to see whether it already has a value, which will cause
problems on Perlmutter. Please ensure that this is not the case in your
dotfiles. Feel free to reach out to [NERSC consulting](https://help.nersc.gov)
with any questions or issues.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### User Information Transmitted to DOE SC <a name="userstats"/></a> 

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (SC), which is the primary 
sponsor of NERSC, requires that a limited set of information relating to your 
user project/experiment be transmitted to SC at the conclusion of the current 
fiscal year. A subset of this information, including your name, institutional 
affiliation(s), and project title(s), will be publicly disseminated as part of 
an SC user facility user projects/experiments database on the SC website, 
<https://science.osti.gov/>, after the conclusion of the fiscal year. For 
proprietary projects, SC requests that the user provide a project title that is 
suitable for public dissemination. 


### New Default Python module at AY transition (Wed Jan 19, 2022) <a name="python"/></a>
