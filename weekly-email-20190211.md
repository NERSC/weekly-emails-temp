## NERSC-Hosted Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp, March 26-29 <a name="kokkostrain"/> ##

NERSC is hosting a Kokkos training event organized by the Exascale Computing
Project (ECP) on March 26-29, 2019 in Oakland. The training will cover the
minimum required topics to get your application started on using Kokkos. Kokkos
experts will be on hand to help beginning and more advanced users.

Kokkos is a programming model and library for writing peformance-portable code
in C++. The abstractions for on-node parallel execution and data layout in
Kokkos are mapped at compile time to fit a device architecture for best
performance. Kokkos could be a valuable tool for creating codes that will run
efficiently on Perlmutter and other architectures.

For more information and to register please see 
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/ppkb2019/>.


## IDEAS-ECP Webinar on Containers in HPC on February 13 <a name="ecpwebinar"/> ##

The February webinar in the Best Practices for HPC Software Developers series is
entitled "Containers in HPC", and will take place this Wednesday, February 13, 
2019, at 10:00 am Pacific time.

This webinar, presented by NERSC's own Shane Canon, will begin with an
introduction on how to build images and run containers on HPC systems, and
include a discussion of best practices to ensure that containers can take full 
advantage of HPC systems.

For more information and to register (there is no cost but registration is
required), please see
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/conthpc/>.


## Not Too Late to Sign up to Attend Remotely Cori KNL Programming and Optimization Training, February 12-13 <a name="coriknltrain"/> ##

On February 12 and 13, NERSC will host a two-day training on programming and
optimizing your code for the KNL architecture. Experts from Cray and NERSC
will give presentations and provide a hands-on session for users who are
interested in porting their codes to run efficiently on the Cori KNL nodes.

It's not too late to sign up to attend remotely! For more information, please
see
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/cori-knl-programming-and-optimization-feb2019/>.


## Call for Science Highlights and NERSC Achievement Award Nominations <a name="highlights"/> ##

NERSC is seeking nominations for early-career and scientific achievements for
the 2018 NERSC Achievement Awards. Submissions must be made by midnight Pacific 
Time on March 8, 2019.

- Do you know a great early-career scientist using NERSC? Nominate them for the
NERSC Early Career Achievement Award at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/science/nersc-hpc-achievement-awards/nominate-early-career/>.

- Have you or someone you know made some outstanding scientific achievements 
thanks to NERSC resources? We are always looking for stories of great science 
backed by NERSC! Please share your research highlights at:
<https://www.nersc.gov/science/science-highlight-submit/>.

When you make a submission at the URL above, you will be asked to attach a short
summary document and a presentation slide. Links to templates are available at 
the top of the submission form. 

Contributions are accepted at any time, but only submissions received before
midnight on March 8 will be considered for this year's awards. For all
submissions, your research may be featured on NERSC and DOE web pages, in press 
releases, and in other communications that emphasize the value of High 
Performance Computing in science.


## Presidents Day Holiday Next Monday; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="presday"/> ##

Consulting and account support will be unavailable next Monday, February 18 due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed Presidents Day holiday. Regular 
consulting and account support services will resume the next day. Operations 
staff are available for urgent queries via 1-800-66-NERSC, Option 1, at all 
times.


## Additional Node Provisioned to Support Jupyter-dev Users <a name="jupyter"/> ##

If you use jupyter-dev.nersc.gov, take note that another node has been added 
for running notebooks on Cori. Now when you run a Jupyter notebook through 
jupyter-dev you will share resources (CPUs, memory) with only about half as 
many users as before. This should help improve the service's reliability, 
**but users are advised to continue to observe the same usage guidelines as 
for Cori login nodes.**

Otherwise the change is largely transparent for users. However, if your 
notebooks connect to external services like databases that have whitelisted 
cori19, or your notebook setup somehow "knows" that you are using cori19, you 
should take into account that your notebook might start up on cori13 now. For
example, if you contact a database that has whitelisted cori19, you need to 
add cori13 to that whitelist.


## Call for Papers for HPML 2019 <a name="hpml"/> ##

The Second High Performance Machine Learning Workshop (HPML 2019) is a workshop
intended to bring together the Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence 
(AI), and High-Performance Computing (HPC) communities to develop important 
cross-disciplinary collaboration. 

HPML 2019 is currently soliciting submissions of original work to the workshop. 
Topics of interest include ML (including deep learning) models; large-scale 
ML applications; statistical models; large-scale data analytics; accelerated 
machine learning; HPC applied to machine learning; benchmarking, performance 
evaluation, and analysis of ML models; hardware acceleration for ML/AI; parallel
ML and AI models; HPC infrastructure and resource management for ML; and 
parallel causal models.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is Saturday, February 16. For more
information, please see 
<https://hpml2019.github.io/>.


## Quota Warnings on Cori and Edison <a name="quotawarn"/> ##

Users who have exceeded any filesystem quotas will notice a new warning
message when they submit a job. The message warns that your account has exceeded
a filesystem quota and suggests running the "myquota" command for more details.

Beginning in two weeks, on Monday, February 25, users who are over any 
filesystem quota will be unable to submit jobs until their storage balance no 
longer exceeds their quota.  This is to protect users from submitting a job and 
having it run, only to lose the output when it cannot be written to disk.

Please submit any questions to NERSC consultants via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.


## This Week on "NERSC User News" Podcast: Energy Efficiency and Environmental Consciousness at NERSC <a name="podcast"/> ##

In this week's NERSC User News podcast, Berkeley Lab Building Technologies and
Urban Systems Division's principal engineering associate and building energy 
efficiency expert Norm Bourassa discusses how NERSC assures that our machines
are operating at peak efficiency with minimal energy overhead, including how we 
take advantage of the mild Berkeley climate, how we look for inefficiencies via 
extensive instrumentation, and what is happening on the global scale as a result
of NERSC's energy efficiency efforts. 

The NERSC User News podcast, produced by the NERSC User Engagement Group, is 
available at <https://anchor.fm/nersc-news> and syndicated through iTunes, 
Google Play, Spotify, and more. A direct link to this week's podcast is 
<https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Energy-Efficiency-and-Environmental-Consciousness-at-NERSC--Norm-Bourassa-Interview-e35tfp/a-aa9ogi>

Please give it a listen and let us know what you think, via a ticket at
<https://help.nersc.gov>.
