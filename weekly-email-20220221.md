## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### President's Day Holiday Today; No Consulting or Account Support <a name="presday"/></a> 

Consulting and account support will be unavailable today, due
to the Berkeley Lab-observed President's Day holiday. Regular 
consulting and account support services will resume tomorrow. 


### NVIDIA Performance Tools for A100 GPU Systems Training Wednesday <a name="nvtools"/></a> 

As part of the ALCF Developer Sessions, there will be a training this Wednesday,
February 23 on NVIDIA Performance Tools for A100 GPU Systems. NVIDIA Developer 
Tools are available for detailed performance analysis of HPC applications 
running on DVIDIA DGX A100 systems, such as Perlmutter and ALCF's ThetaGPU 
systems. Learn to use Nsight Systems for a system-wide visualization of an 
application's performance. Use Nsight Compute for interactive kernel profiling. 
In this session, several use cases of Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute will be
presented via a demo with simple HPC benchmarks on ThetaGPU.

For more information please see 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/nvidia-performance-tools-for-a100-gpus-feb2022>.

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
running user jobs. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon. Anyone interested in using Perlmutter may apply using the 
[Perlmutter Access Request Form](https://nersc.servicenowservices.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D7155797e1b23f490263aa82eac4bcbd7%26sysparm_link_parent%3De15706fc0a0a0aa7007fc21e1ab70c2f%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dcatalog_default%26sysparm_view%3Dcatalog_default).

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, is beginning to
arrive next month. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be 
taken out of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take 
up to 8 weeks. We are developing a plan for integration that will reduce the
amount of time the entire system is down. We will let you know when this plan is
finalized.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Reduction in Perlmutter Node Availability during Cooling System Physical Maintenance <a name="pmcooling"/></a> 

The Perlmutter Phase 1 system, which is currently in its early user 
pre-production stage, requires physical maintenance of the cooling system that 
will take up to 6 weeks to complete. Rather than shut down the entire machine, 
NERSC will perform the maintenance in a rolling fashion with the aim of 
keeping 500 or more nodes available to users. Occasionally, some jobs may see 
decreased GPU performance during this time. We will try to keep as much of the 
system available as possible, but please understand that Perlmutter is not yet 
a production resource with any uptime guarantees.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### Need Help? Check out NERSC Documentation, Send in a Ticket or Consult Your Peers! <a name="gettinghelp"/></a> 

Are you confused about setting up your MFA token? Is there something not quite 
right with your job script that causes the job submission filter to reject it? 
Are you struggling to understand the performance of your code on the KNL nodes?

There are many ways that you can get help with issues at NERSC: 
- First, we recommend the NERSC documentation (<https://docs.nersc.gov/>).
Usually the answers for simpler issues, such as setting up your MFA token using
Google Authenticator, can be found there. (The answers to more complex issues 
can be found in the documentation too!)
- For more complicated issues, or issues that leave you unable to work,
submitting a ticket is a good way to get help fast. NERSC's consulting team
will get back to you within four business-hours (8 am - 5 pm, Monday through
Friday, except holidays) with a response. To submit a ticket, log in to
<https://help.nersc.gov> (or, if the issue prevents you from logging in, send
an email to <accounts@nersc.gov>).
- For queries that might require some back-and-forth, NERSC provides an
[appointment service](https://docs.nersc.gov/getting-started/#appointments-with-nersc-user-support-staff). 
Sign up for an appointment on a variety of topics, including "NERSC 101", KNL 
Optimization, Containers at NERSC, NERSC File Systems, GPU Basics, GPUs in
Python, and Checkpoint/Restart. 
- The NERSC Users Group Slack, while not an official channel for help, is a
place where NERSC users often answer each others' questions, such as whether
anyone else is seeing something strange, or how to get better job
throughput. You can join the NUG Slack by following 
[this link](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/nersc-users-slack/) (login required)
- Sometimes, a colleague can figure out the issue faster than NERSC, because
they already understand your workflow. It's possible that they know what flag
you need to add to your Makefile for better performance, or how to set up your
job submission script just so. 


### Cori OS Upgrade and New Default Environment in March 2022 <a name="coriosupgrade"/></a> 

In order to remain in compliance with minimum requirements for support from
HPE/Cray, Cori will undergo an **operating system (OS) upgrade during the
scheduled maintenance on March 16, 2022.**

At that time, we will also update the default user programming environment on
Cori for the first time since January 2020. The default Cray Developer 
Toolkit (CDT) version will change from 19.11 to **22.02** (note new version), 
and the Intel compiler default will change from 19.0.3.199 to 19.1.2.254. A 
detailed list of software changes (including cray-mpich, cray-libsci, 
cray-netcdf, cray-hdf5, gcc, cce, intel, perftools, etc.) can be found 
[here](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2022Mar/).
NERSC-supported software will be updated to be compatible with the new OS and
CDT. Users will need to relink all statically compiled codes. We also highly
recommend rebuilding all your applications.


### E4S Updates <a name="e4s"/></a> 

#### E4S Versions 20.10 & 21.02 Will Be Deprecated upon Cori OS Upgrade in March

Due to the [upgrade of the operating system on Cori in March](#coriosupgrade), 
the two earliest E4S versions on Cori, 20.10 and 21.02, will be deprecated at 
that time. The module files for these versions have been updated to inform you 
of this change. We encourage you to start using newer versions of E4S at this 
time.

#### E4S Version 21.11 Available on Perlmutter

We are pleased to announce that the E4S/21.11 software stack has been rebuilt
for Perlmutter using GCC version 9.3.0 and NVIDIA version 21.9. We have deployed
a subset of the most commonly used elements of the software stack. It is
accessible via `module load e4s/21.11-tcl` or `module load e4s/21.11-lmod`. Both
point to the same spack instance but employ two different types of module trees.

In addition, we have released instructions on using a containerized
deployment of E4S via Shifter. The container, provided by the E4S team, 
includes the full E4S software stack built on Ubuntu 20.04.

For more information, please see the E4S documentation at
<https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/e4s/perlmutter/21.11/>.

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section6"/></a> ##

### Introduction to Programming with SYCL on Perlmutter & Beyond, March 1 <a name="sycl"/></a> 

SYCL is an open-standard programming model that allows developers to program for
a range of GPUs and other accelerator processors using standard C++ code. This
means your standard C++ code can target Nvidia, AMD, and Intel GPUs from a
single code base. Engineers from Codeplay have partnered with national labs to
bring SYCL support to Perlmutter, Polaris, and Frontier.

Join Codeplay engineers on March 1 for a half-day, hands-on workshop covering 
the fundamentals of SYCL programming, including practical examples and exercises
to help reinforce the concepts being learned. Attendees will learn how to 
compile their SYCL code using the DPC++ compiler to target Nvidia GPUs such as 
on Perlmutter. We'll end with useful tips to achieve good performance, including
best practices for memory management, with free time for questions and
discussions.
