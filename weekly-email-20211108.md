## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### NERSC Operations Continue, with Minimal Changes <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is located, is operating under public health 
restrictions. NERSC continues to remain open while following site-specific 
protection plans. We remain in operation, with the majority of NERSC staff 
working remotely, and staff essential to operations onsite. We do not 
expect significant changes to our operations in the next few months.

You can continue to expect regular online consulting and account support as well
as schedulable online appointments. Trainings continue to be held online. 
Regular maintenances on the systems continue to be performed while minimizing 
onsite staff presence, which could result in longer downtimes than would occur 
under normal circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you continue to refrain 
from calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

For **current NERSC systems status**, please see the online 
[MOTD](https://www.nersc.gov/live-status/motd/) and 
[current known issues](https://docs.nersc.gov/current/) webpages.

## This Week's Events and Deadlines <a name="section2"/></a> ##

### IDEAS-ECP Webinar on 55+ Years in HPC: One Woman's Experiences & Perspectives, this Wednesday! <a name="ecpwebinar2"/></a> 

The November webinar in the 
[Best Practices for HPC Software Developers](http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/) 
series is entitled "55+ Years in High-Performance Computing: One Woman's
Experiences and Perspectives"
and will take place **this Wednesday, November 10, 2021, at 10:00 am 
Pacific time.**

This webinar's format will be different than the others. Jean Shuler (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory) has worked at the leading edge of HPC for 5
decades. This webinar will be a Q&A on the fascinating career of a woman who 
taught herself programming on the job at NASA Langley beginning in 1963, and
found her way to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by 1972, sparking a
long career helping others to find their way in HPC. Jean created and led the
User Services program at NERSC (then housed at LLNL). When NERSC moved to
Berkeley Lab in 1996, Jean applied her passion and experience to support the
ASCI program users at Livermore Computing.

If you have an interest in computing history, the experiences and impact of
women in computing, or if you are early in your career and looking for 
inspiration, you will want to attend this webinar and listen to Jean's amazing
stories and ask her some questions!

There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. Please register
[here](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/55plus-years-in-hpc/).

## Perlmutter <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Perlmutter Machine Status <a name="perlmutter"/></a> 

The initial phase of the Perlmutter supercomputer is in the NERSC machine room, 
booting and running successfully. 

We have added many early users onto the machine. We hope to add even more users 
soon.

The second phase of the machine, consisting of CPU-only nodes, will arrive in
early 2022. After all the new nodes arrive, all of Perlmutter will be taken out
of service and integrated over a period that we anticipate could take up to 8 
weeks.

This newsletter item will be updated each week with the latest Perlmutter 
status.


### Prepare Your Dotfiles for Perlmutter! <a name="dotfiles"/></a> 

To help ready your account for Perlmutter, please review your dotfiles. The same
home file system is mounted across all NERSC systems, so your 
`.bashrc`/`.cshrc`/etc. files (dotfiles) need to work on all systems. The
NERSC\_HOST variable can help you distinguish between systems and to set 
customizations for each system. The NERSC\_HOST variable is set automatically to
"perlmutter" on Perlmutter and to "cori" on Cori. 

Some users may have older dot files that are setting the NERSC\_HOST variable 
without first checking to see whether it already has a value, which will cause
problems on Perlmutter. Please ensure that this is not the case in your
dotfiles. Feel free to reach out to [NERSC consulting](https://help.nersc.gov)
with any questions or issues.

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section4"/></a> ##

### New Default Python module at AY transition (Wed Jan 19, 2022) <a name="python"/></a> 

Python users take note: On Jan 19, 2022 at the Allocation Year rollover, NERSC 
will change our default Python and Python3 modules on Cori to 
python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05. Please note that older Python modules will remain 
available, but users must specify the full module name to continue to use them.

Updates in this module include:
- Mamba 0.7.3 (a faster alternative to conda)
- netcdf4 1.5.3
- mpi4py 3.1.1
- authlib 0.15.4 (support for NERSC's [Superfacility API](https://docs-dev.nersc.gov/sfapi/))

Full release notes are available here: <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/reference/release-notes/#anaconda-2021-05-may-13-2021>.

pip users should be aware that pip packages installed via `--user` will be 
installed at `$HOME/.local/cori/3.8-anaconda-2021.05` (defined by 
`$PYTHONUSERBASE`).

This module is available now via `module load python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05`, so 
we encourage you to test it now. If you notice issues or have questions please 
contact us at <https://help.nersc.gov>. NERSC Python users will find a lot of 
helpful information and advice in our Python documentation: <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/languages/python/nersc-python/>. 

Note that the python/3.8-anaconda-2021.05 module is already the default on
Perlmutter. There are no scheduled Python module changes on Perlmutter. 


### NERSC Annual Report and User Demographics Now Available Online! <a name="annualrep"/></a> 

The [NERSC 2020 Annual Report](https://www.nersc.gov/assets/Uploads/NERSC-2020-Annual-Report-Final.pdf) 
(pdf) is now available online. Learn about NERSC's response to the unique

### Apply for Prestigious Alvarez & Hopper Fellowships in Computing Sciences at Berkeley Lab & NERSC by November 22 <a name="alvarezhopper"/></a> 

Are you about to earn your PhD in a computational science discipline or have you
earned it within the past three years? Are you looking for a position in which 
you can set your own research agenda within the broad computing science field? 
Consider applying for the 2022 Luis W. Alvarez Postdoctoral Fellowship or 
the 2022 Admiral Grace Hopper Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Computing Sciences 
Area at Berkeley Lab!

The [Luis W. Alvarez fellowship](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/alvarez-fellowship/), 
established in 2002, offers challenging research opportunities in the 
development of computational methods and tools for scientific discovery. 
Fellows apply the latest technologies to computational modeling, simulations, 
and advanced data analysis for scientific discovery in materials science, 
biology, astronomy, environmental science, energy, particle physics, genomics, 
and other scientific domains.

The [Admiral Grace Hopper Fellowship](https://cs.lbl.gov/careers/computing-fellowships/hopper-fellowship/)
was established in 2015 with the goal of developing early-career computational 
scientists to make outstanding contributions in the area of HPC applications. 
Applicants should have expertise with advanced algorithms, software techniques, 
HPC systems, and/or networking in a related research field.

Applications to both fellowships are made jointly by a single process. For
more information and to apply, please see the 
[position listing](http://m.rfer.us/LBLq6B4Aw). 
Applications close on November 22, 2021.
