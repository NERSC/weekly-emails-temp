## Low QOS Now Available on Cori KNL

NERSC is reintroducing the low queue for user jobs on Cori's KNL nodes. For
this Quality of Service (QOS), users receive a 50% NERSC-hour discount in
exchange for a reduction in the priority of jobs submitted to the low QOS. Jobs
submitted in the low QOS are not eligible for the big-jobs discount.

Through the course of the allocation year, the low QOS may be suspended and 
reinstated depending on the volume of jobs in the queue.
