### Three-Part Parallelware for GPU Programming Training Series, Oct 27, Oct 29, & Nov 4, Begins Tomorrow!

Join [Appentra](https://www.appentra.com) and NERSC for a three-part
Parallelware training series, with the goal of helping new and experienced
programmers learn best practices for GPU programming with OpenMP and OpenACC.

The training will feature example exercises, with the parallelization of ZPIC
guided by Parallelware tools as a case study, focusing on GPU programming
challenges that frequently appear in real scientific and engineering 
applications.

The three sessions will be held Tuesday, October 27, Thursday, October 29, and
Wednesday, November 4. For more information and to register, please see
