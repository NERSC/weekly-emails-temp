## Shifter Now Available on Cori Login Nodes

Shifter can now be used on Cori login nodes. The normal Shifter commands
(shifterimg, shifter) can be used to pull and run images. This enhanced
capability should be useful for testing images before running in a batch job or
using the same images for interactive use cases like data analysis or
development. Please consult the NERSC help pages (e.g., 
<https://www.nersc.gov/users/software/using-shifter-and-docker/using-shifter-at-nersc/>
or <http://docs.nersc.gov/development/shifter/how-to-use/>) for more 
information, or submit a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov>.
