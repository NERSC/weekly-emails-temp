## Please Delay Moving Data to HPSS

NERSC requests that users not archive large amounts of data to HPSS at this 
time. The HPSS system is in the process of being moved from Oakland to Berkeley.
The plan involves standing up a new archive system in our machine room at 
Berkeley Lab, and migrating the data in the old system from Berkeley to Oakland 
via our 400 Gbit connection between the two sites. For more information on
precisely how this is being performed (plus a lot of other useful information
on how HPSS works), please listen to the NERSC User News podcast interview
with Wayne Hurlbert:

The tapes for the old system are incompatible with the new system so therefore 
any money spent on tapes for the old system reduces the amount of money we can
invest in tapes for the new system. This is why we request that you temporarily
delay until the new system is online. We anticipate that the new system will be
available to users
