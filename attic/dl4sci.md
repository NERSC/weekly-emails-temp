### Call for Applications: Deep Learning for Science School due this Wednesday

Are you interested in applying deep learning to your science problem? Would you
like to learn more about the capabilities of deep learning and how to use it in
high-performance computing environments, and connect with other scientists
working on similar problems?

NERSC, in collaboration with the Computing Sciences area at Berkeley Lab, is
hosting the second Deep Learning for Science School July 20-24, 2020. The school
will bring together researchers and engineers for lectures and tutorials on
state-of-the-art deep learning methods and best practices for running deep
learning on high-performance computing systems, and provide opportunities to
connect with fellow scientists with a shared interest in how the latest advances
in learning algorithms can be used for their science.
