## Please Delete Unnecessary Files from Cori Scratch

The amount of data stored on the Cori scratch filesystem, cscratch1, is fast 
approaching 80% of its capacity. At that point, performance of the scratch 
filesystem begins to degrade rapidly. We therefore request that all users take
some time this week to look through their scratch directory on Cori and delete
any unnecessary files.
