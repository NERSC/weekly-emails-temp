## FICUS Proposals (JGI/NERSC/KBase Joint Call) Due Today!

The 2019 FICUS JGI-NERSC-KBase Biological Data Science call for proposals 
closes today! Users will be given access to resources and capabilities through 
two DOE Office of Science User Facilities -- the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) 
and NERSC -- as well as the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase). The call 
aims to help users perform large-scale computational analyses of genomics and 
related omics data to solve problems relevant to the DOE missions in bioenergy 
and the environment.
