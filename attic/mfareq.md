## Now Enabled: MFA on Most NERSC Systems

In an email to NERSC users, NERSC Director Sudip Dosanjh announced that NERSC 
will require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing NERSC systems in 
the majority of cases starting in the new allocation year.

NERSC's goal is to minimize the disruption that users will experience in going 
to MFA, while preserving the safety of users' accounts and data. We have worked
hard to achieve that balance and believe that in some cases, users may enjoy
increased flexibility through our MFA implementation.

Currently, MFA is enabled on the majority of systems at NERSC. Most recently, 
MFA was enabled on the NERSC myproxy server, which impacts users of NEWT, 
<https://my.nersc.gov>, and NERSC globus endpoints.

For more information about MFA at NERSC, there are many resources, including:
- [The NERSC MFA webpage](https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa), which is a trove of information about the MFA infrastructure at NERSC;
- Two recent NERSC User News podcast interviews with Abe Singer: 
    - [November 26, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Multi-Factor-Authentication-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e2kmad),
in which Abe discusses what will happen in the new allocation year when MFA
becomes mandatory and answers common user questions about using MFA, and
    - [September 17, 2018](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Latest-MFA-Developments-at-NERSC--Abe-Singer-Interview-e288uq),
in which Abe discusses the sshproxy tool and answers common user questions about
MFA;
- The NUG Monthly Webinar: there is a [video](https://youtu.be/vLzihdTX4kg) of 
the [September 27 webinar](https://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-sept-27-2018/)
which included in-depth information about sshproxy and more, and slides from the
[November 1 webinar](http://www.nersc.gov/users/NUG/teleconferences/nug-webinar-nov-1-2018/), 
in which we covered using MFA at NERSC, are also available.

In addition, NERSC will be developing more MFA-related content and providing
opportunities for users to get some additional assistance in the upcoming weeks.

And of course NERSC consultants are always happy to take your questions via a
ticket at <https://help.nersc.gov>.

We encourage you to try out these features before MFA becomes mandatory in the
new allocation year.
