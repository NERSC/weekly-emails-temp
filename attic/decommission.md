## Edison is Retired

Edison is now retired.

As of 7 am Pacific time today, the system was permanently powered off. It is now
being disconnected from the facility power and water systems, and then the 
system will be disassembled. The space formerly occupied by Edison will then 
begin the transformation into space for the new 
[Perlmutter](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/perlmutter/) 
machine, which arrives at the end of 2020.
