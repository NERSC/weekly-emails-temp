## Appentra Parallelware Tool Training on October 17!

NERSC is always looking for new ways to improve user experience while coding.
One ever-present challenge in high-performance computing is how to parallelize 
your code to improve on-node or offload performance. Many users struggle with
getting this right. Fortunately, Appentra has developed the 
[Parallelware](https://www.appentra.com/products/parallelware-trainer/) Trainer
Tool to teach you!

NERSC has partnered with Appentra to offer a one-day training for users to get
more familiar with this new tool. This training, which will be taught by 
Appentra founder Manuel Arneaz, will be offered on Thursday, October 17 at 
NERSC. It will begin with an overview of the tool and how to use it, and 
continue with a hands-on session for the remainder of the day.

Registration information and agenda for the day are available at:
