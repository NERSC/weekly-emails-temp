### JupyterLab 3 Comes to NERSC May 20 

NERSC currently supports JupyterLab 2 in production. JupyterLab 3 was released 
several months ago and we have been watching its development closely. We have 
had a parallel JupyterLab 3 deployment in testing for several months now, with 
staff and early users kicking the tires. We have been keeping tabs on and 
actively helping with migration of relevant JupyterLab extensions to 
JupyterLab 3. We have also been working on understanding JupyterLab 3's new 
extension installation system and what role it can play in our deployment. For 
more info on JupyterLab 3 and what's changed from JupyterLab 2, see this 
[blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-3-0-is-out-4f58385e25bb) and 
the more detailed 
[changelog](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/changelog.html).

Progress is such that we believe we can upgrade to JupyterLab 3 soon. We have 
planned the upgrade to coincide with the Cori maintenance, this Wednesday 
through Thursday, May 19-20. If all goes well after that maintenance, 
JupyterLab 3 will replace JupyterLab 2 at NERSC.
