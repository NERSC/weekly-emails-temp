### Submit a Paper to the Interactive HPC 2020 Workshop

NERSC recognizes the growing demand for interactive, real-time, and urgent 
HPC-based workflows.  The interactive QOS on Cori is a hugely popular feature.
The real-time QOS enables urgent fast-turnaround processing for experimental and
observational data workloads. Jupyter has become a major point of entry and 
platform for interactive ML/DL for NERSC users.

Do you have an interactive, real-time, or urgent HPC workflow at NERSC you'd 
like to share with the world? Then please consider submitting a paper to the 
Fourth Workshop on Interactivity in HPC (InteractiveHPC) by September 4, 2020. 
Position papers or manuscripts on completed work or work in progress are welcome
(up to 10 pages). The workshop itself will be held virtually on November 11, 12,
or 13, in conjunction with SuperComputing 2020.
