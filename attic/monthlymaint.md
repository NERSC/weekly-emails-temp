### May Monthly Maintenance on Wednesday

This month's Cori maintenance will take place on Wednesday. The maintenance will
be longer than typical so that we can perform updates on the Cori scratch file
system. The maintenance will begin at 7:00 am (Pacific time) on Wednesday, May
19 and extend through 9:00 pm Thursday, May 20.

The updates will address more than 30 issues, including some bugs that have
recently caused multi-hour system outages. While the maintenance will take
longer than usual, we believe that it will pay off over the long term in
improvements to the reliability of the scratch file system.

This maintenance impacts anything the Cori scratch file system touches;
therefore all nodes, including the login nodes, Haswell and KNL compute nodes,
large memory nodes, GPU nodes, and exvivo partition will be unavailable for the
duration of the maintenance period. In addition, the Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)
will be in a degraded state during this period since the Cori scratch file
system will not be mounted.
