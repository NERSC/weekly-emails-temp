## Call for Proposals: High-Impact Science at Scale on Cori

NERSC is seeking proposals to conduct high-impact science campaigns using
NERSC's Cori supercomputer at scale. A successful proposal would require the use
of at least 2000 KNL nodes to solve a problem, with a preference for proposals
that exploit Cori's unique capabilities (e.g., using all or most of the 9688
KNL nodes or making heavy use of the burst buffer). Data-intensive projects
requiring large-scale analytics (statistics, machine learning, deep learning)
are encouraged to apply.

Previous awards were in the range of 10-100 million NERSC hours. The number of
awarded projects will be determined based on the number, quality, and diversity
of responses, as well as by the aggregate amount of time requested. **This call
will remain open on an ongoing basis and submissions will be evaluated every two
weeks.**
