### New Format for Ticket-Generated Emails

You may have already noticed the improved look for emails auto-generated by
NERSC's ticketing system (ServiceNow). NERSC has been hard at work improving the
user helpdesk experience, first with the web portal and improvements to request
forms, and now with better email responses to user tickets. Please let us know
what you think, or if you have any ideas that can make it even easier for us to
help you, by opening a [ticket](https://help.nersc.gov).
