## Submissions for ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowships in Computational and Data Science Close TODAY

Are you a currently enrolled graduate student focusing on computational or data 
science (or will you be one no later than October 15)? Are you a woman or a 
member of a racial or ethnic group that is currently underrepresented in the 
computing field in the country where you are studying? If so, you may be 
eligible to apply for the ACM SIGHPC Graduate Fellowship in Computational 
and Data Science.

Each fellowship recipient will receive a stipend of US$15000 annually for up to 
5 years as long as they are progressing in their degree program. In the case of 
non-US universities, the stipend will be adjusted depending on World Bank 
national price level ratio for the country where the degree will be earned. In 
addition, new fellowship recipients will be supported to travel to the annual SC
conference, where they will be honored at the awards session.

The submissions close **today**. For more information please see
