### Training on OpenMP Device Offload, Wednesday & Thursday

In collaboration with OLCF, NERSC will offer a two-day training, "Introduction 
to OpenMP GPU Offloading," this Wednesday and Thursday, September 22-23.

Each day of the training will consist of a lecture followed by hands-on
exercises for participants to work through. The first day provides a general
overview of the OpenMP programming model and the basics of using OpenMP
directives to offload work to GPUs. The second day includes optimization
strategies, efficient data movement, and the hierarchy of parallelism to
lead to improved performance.

Hands-on exercises will be available in both C and Fortran.
