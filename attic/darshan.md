### Updated Darshan Module Becomes Default Today!

Darshan 3.2.1 will be made a default module today, February 22, 2021 on 
Cori. We use Darshan to collect details about I/O and file systems usage by 
NERSC users. (Note: while a darshan module is already loaded on Cori, the module
has not been active since the transition from static linking to dynamic linking 
in Dec 2019.)

More details can be found at 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/development/performance-debugging-tools/darshan>. 
Please report any issues to [NERSC consulting](https://help.nersc.gov).
