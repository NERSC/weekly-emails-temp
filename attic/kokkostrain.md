## It's Not Too Late to Register for Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp, March 26-29!

NERSC is hosting a Kokkos training event organized by the Exascale Computing
Project (ECP) on March 26-29, 2019 in Oakland. The training will cover the
minimum required topics to get your application started on using Kokkos. Kokkos
experts will be on hand to help beginning and more advanced users.

Kokkos is a programming model and library for writing peformance-portable code
in C++. The abstractions for on-node parallel execution and data layout in
Kokkos are mapped at compile time to fit a device architecture for best
performance. Kokkos could be a valuable tool for creating codes that will run
efficiently on Perlmutter and other architectures.

For more information and to register please see

tomorrow!
