## DataWarp (Burst Buffer) Maintenance Tomorrow

Another part of the Cori maintenance process will be an upgrade to the
firmware and a reconfiguration of the Datawarp system. These changes will
increase the reliability of the burst buffer, improve performance for small
reservations, and add the capability for even larger reservations. Note that the
sm_pool will no longer exist after the maintenance.

**This process will delete all data on the burst buffer, including persistent
reservations.** Please back up your data before the maintenance starts 
tomorrow.
