## OpenMP Training: Beyond the Common Core on Friday ##

It's not too late to register to attend remotely the OpenMP "Beyond the
Common Core" training on Friday!

Tim Mattson from Intel and Helen He from NERSC will present a full day of 
intermediate-level OpenMP training at NERSC on Friday, May 4. Tim Mattson is 
one of the creators of OpenMP, and has given engaging tutorials on OpenMP across
its two decades of existence. Helen He is NERSC's representative on the OpenMP
committee and an expert on its syntax and functionality.

Programmers may spend their entire OpenMP programming careers safely inside the
common core. Well rounded OpenMP programmers, however, should be aware of what
lays just beyond the common core. These less common features of OpenMP were
included in the language for a good reason and only by understanding them at a
high level can you know when you might need them. In this **hands-on tutorial**, 
you will gain experience working outside the common core. We won't cover every
single feature beyond the common core, but we will survey them with enough
breadth so following this tutorial, you will be able to pick up and work with
what you need.

For the best experience, we recommend attending in person if at all possible, to
get the most out of the hands-on portions of the training.
The tutorial is being held in **Building 50B, Room 1237** on the Berkeley Lab 
campus. For registration and Zoom connection details please see
