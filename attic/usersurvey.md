## NERSC User Survey for AY 2018 Closes Thursday!

If you haven't already taken the NERSC user survey, there's still time -- we've 
extended the closing date to January 31!

Please help NERSC to judge the quality of our services and point us to areas
where we can improve, by taking the [NERSC 2018 User 
Survey](https://nersc.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fassessment_take2.do%3Fsysparm_assessable_type%3D0ee5a02ddb82e700b259fb0e0f96196f).

Based on user feedback, we have shortened the survey substantially, so it
should take only a few minutes to complete. The survey covers the allocation
year 2018 and closes on January 31, 2019.

If you are not already logged in to the NERSC web site, you will be prompted
for your NERSC (NIM) password when you start the survey. If you need to reset 
your password, please try to do so at <https://nim.nersc.gov/> before contacting
our account support office at 1-800-66-NERSC (or 510-486-8600), menu option 2.
