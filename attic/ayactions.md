## Unable to Log In? Read on to Learn Possible Reasons Why

Some users have experienced the unpleasant surprise of being unable to log in to
NERSC resources in the new Allocation Year (AY). Here are the possible causes,
in descending order of frequency:
- **You need to fill out the new Appropriate Use Policy (AUP).** A new AUP is in
effect for AY19, and users need to agree to it before accessing NERSC resources.
Sign into NIM (<https://nim.nersc.gov>) to sign the form.
- **You need to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).** MFA is now required 
for accessing NERSC resources in the majority of cases. Please take a look at
the [NERSC MFA Page](https://www.nersc.gov/users/connecting-to-nersc/mfa/)
to learn how, and sign into NIM (<https://nim.nersc.gov>) to create your token.
- **You are not associated with an AY19 repo.** Before the new AY, we asked
PIs of repos that were continuing into the new year to validate their user
lists. By default, all users were set to be discontinued. You can find out
whether you are associated with an AY19 repo by logging into NIM 
(<https://nim.nersc.gov>) and looking at the "Roles" tab. If you are not in a
repo that you expected, please contact your PI and request that they add you
to the repo.
- **Your account is disabled pending NERSC review.** NERSC has been directed by
our sponsor, the Department of Energy, to implement a new vetting process for
user accounts. Some users require additional screening and their accounts have
been disabled. Because this is the first time that we have performed this
process, some users may experience an additional delay in access to their
accounts. We appreciate your patience as we go through this process.
