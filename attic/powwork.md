### Current NERSC Outage for Power Upgrade, Maintenance 

Over this past weekend NERSC underwent a site-wide outage as our power supply 
was upgraded to support Perlmutter, which is scheduled to arrive around the 
end of this year. The outage is scheduled to continue until 23:59 Tuesday 
February 25, and includes maintenance work for Cori and other NERSC resources. 

The power work went well, and the maintenance is on track to complete 
overnight. Please check <https://www.nersc.gov/users/live-status/>
