## NoMachine Hardware and Desktop Upgrade April 10 ##
 
On April 10th, the NoMachine service will be migrated to new hardware. We will take a 
maintenance the 10th to switch over to the new instance which will require termination 
of all running sessions. The new setup will have better reliability and failover and a 
new Gnome desktop with more customizable options.
