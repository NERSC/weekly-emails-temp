## Cori Maintenance on Wednesday

Cori will be down for maintenance this Wednesday, October 17. During this
maintenance, the login nodes and Cori scratch filesystem (cscratch1) will remain
available, but no jobs will run. During the maintenance, the batch system will 
be upgraded to version 18.08, the Datawarp patch will be installed, and a short 
test will be run on Cori scratch. During the test, a reservation will be put in 
place to prevent Edison jobs from using cscratch1.

The maintenance will commence at 7:00 am and we expect to return the machine to
users before 7:00 pm (Pacific).
