### Join Us for the Roofline on NVIDIA GPUs Hackathon Next Wednesday, July 8!

The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive and insightful way to 
understand application performance, identify bottlenecks, and perform 
optimization for HPC applications. In preparation for the upcoming supercomputer
Perlmutter at NERSC, this hackathon invites all NERSC users to join us for some 
informative talks, lively discussions and engaging hands-on sessions, all 
related to Roofline analysis on NVIDIA GPUs!
