## UPC++ Workshop on November 1 at NERSC

UPC++ is a C++11 library providing classes and functions that support 
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming. UPC++ provides mechanisms 
for low-overhead one-sided communication, moving computation to data through 
remote-procedure calls, and expressing dependencies between asynchronous 
computations and data movement. It is particularly well-suited for implementing 
elaborate distributed data structures where communication is irregular or 
fine-grained. The UPC++ interfaces are designed to be composable and similar to 
those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to
run at close to hardware speeds.

In this tutorial we will introduce basic concepts and advanced optimization 
techniques of UPC++. We will discuss the UPC++ memory and execution models and 
walk through implementing basic algorithms in UPC++. We will also look at 
irregular applications and how to take advantage of UPC++ features to optimize 
their performance.

The tutorial will be held at NERSC on November 1st from 9am to 2pm (Pacific time). 
Registration for on-site attendance is now closed, but participants can still 
audit the tutorial remotely via Zoom at https://lbnl.zoom.us/j/990555138.
