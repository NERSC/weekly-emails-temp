## MongoDB services on mongodb0X upgrade to 3.4(.16) Next Monday

At the upcoming center-wide outage, we will upgrade the MongoDB services to 
3.4(.16) (from the current 3.2.16) as 3.2 is approach end-of-life. While we do 
not expect any major compatibility issues, please check 
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-compatibility/> and 
<https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/#driver-compatibility> 
for any potential problems for your particular use-case.
