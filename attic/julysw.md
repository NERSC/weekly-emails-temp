## Programming Environment Changes on Cori and Edison this Month 

Last week Cori returned to service following its maintenance with a new default
programming environment. Likewise, this Wednesday (July 25) Edison will return 
to service with this new default programming environment after its maintenance.
This is in compliance with the NERSC Programming Environment Update Policy (see
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/software-policies/software-update-policies-on-programming-environment/>
for more details).

During the maintenance, we will change the default Cray Developer Toolkit (CDT)
version from 17.09 to 18.03. CDT 17.09 will remain available, but the version
that was default last year, 17.06, will be removed. In addition, we will install
a future-looking version, 18.06.

As a consequence of this change, the default versions of many packages will
change. The default version of the Intel compiler, however, will remain the
same. For more details on precisely what will change, please see
