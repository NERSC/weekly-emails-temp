### Default Python on DTNs Changed to Python 3 Effective Today

NERSC has changed the default Python module on the Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)
to Python 3, effective today. Python 2 will remain but will no longer be the 
default. Note that the minimal set of libraries provided in the DTN Python 3 
module were selected to assist with data movement rather than provide a full
suite of applications as on Cori.
