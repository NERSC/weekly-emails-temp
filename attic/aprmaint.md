### April Cori Maintenance Planned to Begin Tomorrow Evening (April 21)

The April monthly maintenance includes a Cori scratch file system check that was
rescheduled from March. The file system check is a lengthy process so instead of
starting the maintenance on Wednesday morning as usual, we will begin at 10:00 
pm (Pacific time) tomorrow, Tuesday, April 21. At that time, Cori and the Cori 
scratch system will become unavailable to users. Coinciding with this 
maintenance we will also perform a short maintenance on the Data Transfer Nodes 
(DTNs) during the first hour of the maintenance period. For the remaining time, 
the DTNs will be up but in a degraded state due to the unavailability of Cori 
scratch.

We expect that the maintenance will be complete and all systems returned to 
users by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, April 22.
