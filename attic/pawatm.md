### Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI+X Deadline Extended to this Wednesday, August 11!

The Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI+X (PAW-ATM) is seeking 
full-length papers and extended abstracts for the workshop to be held in 
conjunction with SC21 in St. Louis, Missouri in mid-November. PAW-ATM is a forum
for discussing HPC applications written in alternatives to MPI+X. These 
alternatives include new languages (e.g., Chapel, Regent, XcalableMP), 
frameworks for large-scale data science (e.g., Arkouda, Dask, Spark), and 
extensions to existing languages (e.g., Charm++, COMPSs, Fortran, Legion, 
UPC++). 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using high-level parallel programming languages 
and frameworks.
- Examples that demonstrate performance, compiler optimization, error checking, 
and reduced software complexity.
- Applications from artificial intelligence, data analytics, bioinformatics, and
other novel areas.
- Performance evaluation of applications developed using alternatives to MPI+X 
and comparisons to standard programming models.
- Novel algorithms enabled by high-level parallel abstractions.
- Experience with the use of new compilers and runtime environments.
- Libraries using or supporting alternatives to MPI+X.
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

The submission deadline has been extended until **this Wednesday, August 11, 2021**.
