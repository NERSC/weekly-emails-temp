## Call for Papers: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to MPI (PAW-ATM)

The organizers of the PAW-ATM: Parallel Applications Workshop, Alternatives to
MPI are seeking full-length papers and extended abstracts for their workshop, to
be held in conjunction with SC19 in Denver, Colorado, in mid-November, 2019.

Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Novel application development using high-level parallel programming languages 
and frameworks;
- Examples demonstrating performance, compiler optimization, error checking, and
reduced software complexity;
- Applications from big data analytics, bioinformatics, or other novel areas;
- Novel algorithms enabled by high-level parallel abstractions;
- Experience with the use of new compiler and runtime environments;
- Performance of applications using MPI alternatives;
- Benefits of hardware abstraction and data locality on algorithm 
implementation.

Submissions are due **July 31, 2019**. For more information and to submit, 
please see <http://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/>.
