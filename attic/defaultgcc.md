## Default gcc Module (Version 7.0.3) Will Be Loaded on Cori and Edison Starting Today 

To support the latest Intel C++ compilers that require the C++14-conformant GCC 
compilers, the default gcc module (currently the default version is 7.0.3) on 
Cori and Edison will be loaded by default starting today, April 29. If you
work with legacy codes that require an older GCC version (e.g., the 4.8.5 from 
the system default path), or if this this ends up creating problems for you, 
simply unload the gcc module. 

Please submit a ticket to <https://help.nersc.gov> with any concerns or 
comments.
