### Please Take the Machine Learning at NERSC Survey!

NERSC is conducting a [survey](https://bit.ly/3d28ZdM) of scientific researchers
who are developing and using machine-learning (ML) models for scientific 
problems. We want to better understand users' current and future ML ecosystem 
and computational needs for development, training, and deployment of models. 

Your feedback is critical! It will help us optimize Cori and also Perlmutter for
ML capability and performance. Please take the survey at
