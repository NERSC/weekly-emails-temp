### Apply for the NERSC GPU Hackathon by Wednesday!

NERSC, in conjunction with NVIDIA and OLCF, will be hosting a GPU Hackathon 
from July 26th-28th with an opening day on July 19th as part of the annual 
[GPU Hackathon Series](https://gpuhackathons.org/). The hackathon will be held 
virtually.

GPU Hackathons are four-day events designed to help scientists, researchers, and
developers accelerate and optimize their applications to run on GPUs. Attendee
teams are paired with experienced GPU mentors to learn the critical accelerated
and parallel programming skills needed by their scientific community. 

Code teams apply to participate in the event. **We highly encourage Open Science
teams in the process of porting GPUs to apply.** If you're unable to make this
Hackathon, feel free to look for another event at the link above.

Teams should consist of three or more developers who are intimately familiar 
with the relevant parts of their application. They will work alongside mentors 
with GPU programming expertise relevant to their needs. If you want/need to get 
your code running/optimized on a GPU-accelerated system, these hackathons offer 
a unique opportunity to set aside 4 days, surround yourself with experts in the 
field, and achieve great strides toward your development goals. 

For more information, or to submit a short proposal form, please visit the 
[GPU Hackathons event page](https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/nersc-gpu-hackathon-2021) 
or [NERSC's event page](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/nersc-gpuhackathon-2021).

Please note the deadline to submit a proposal is 11:59 pm (Pacific time), this
Wednesday, May 19th, 2021. If you have any questions, please feel free to 
contact Kevin Gott (kngott@lbl.gov).
