### Help Testing New Portal Platform Requested

The science gateway service <https://portal.nersc.gov/> ("portal") is migrating 
to NERSC's container-as-a-service platform, Spin. NERSC staff already have 
created a version of portal in Spin that duplicates the old virtual 
machine-based service. This new prototype seems to be functioning properly and 
serving the same content as the original.

We need help from our users to finish verifying that the prototype is working 
properly before we take it live. If you have never used portal or never heard of
it, you can stop reading here. But if you have ever placed content at 
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<project>/www` you may want to participate. The procedure for
testing the prototype portal service takes only a few minutes, and is outlined 
here:
<https://docs.nersc.gov/services/science-gateways/#special-notice-help-us-test-the-new-portalnerscgov>

The migration is expected to take effect July 31.
