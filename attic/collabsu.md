## Method for Accessing Collaboration Accounts Updated

NERSC has deployed an updated method for accessing collaboration accounts. 
Collaboration accounts, accounts connected to a repo that can be shared among 
its members to facilitate data and software management as well as production 
jobs, were accessed via gsissh in the past. 

Now, on Cori and Edison, the command to become a collaboration account has been 
simplified. Just typing "collabsu <collab_account_name>" and entering your NERSC
password is all you need to do. Access to these collaboration accounts is still 
controlled by the PI or PI Proxy. Collabsu is not yet deployed on the DTN nodes,
but will be soon. Please see 
<https://docs.nersc.gov/accounts/collaboration_accounts/> 
for more details.
