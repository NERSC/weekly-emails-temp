## Iris Replacing NIM in 2020, Launching this Thursday

NIM has served NERSC well for over 20 years and is ready to retire! Over the 
last 12 months we have been developing [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov), a
modern, fast, and intuitive interface for managing your NERSC account and 
resource usage.

Currently Iris is running in read-only mode - meaning you can use it to look at 
your details and usage, but not change them yet. This Thursday, NIM will be set 
to read-only mode and Iris will become the primary interface for managing your 
NERSC account.

In the morning on Thursday, December 5, NIM will be frozen and may be down for a
while during the conversion. Iris will be set up to become the authoritative
source of all information, which may require it to be unavailable for periods of
time as well. We expect to bring Iris up in the afternoon on Thursday, well
before Cori is returned to service.
