## Cori maintenance Dec 5, new programming environment available

Due to the power outages in October and the Supercomputing Conference in November,
the usually-scheduled maintenance for Cori has been moved to Thursday December 5.
This maintenance will include a minor OS update from CLE7.0UP01 to CLE7.0UP02, and 
installation of `cdt/19.11`. The CDT includes programming environments, and 19.11 
is the candidate for becoming the default at the start of the 2020 ERCAP year, so 
please test it and [let us know](https://help.nersc.gov) if you discover problems 
running your workflows. You can load the new programming environment with 
`module load cdt/19.11`.
