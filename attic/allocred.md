## Quarterly Allocation Adjustments tomorrow, Tuesday October 15

Computational repositories that are not ALCC or DDR projects and have not 
charged significant amounts of NERSC hours are adjusted on a quarterly basis, 
by returning a portion of their unused balance to the corresponding DOE Office 
reserve. 

We were unable to perform the adjustments on October 9 due to the power outage,
so they will instead occur tomorrow, October 15th:

- If charged usage is less than 40% remove 25% of the unused balance.
- If charged usage is less than 20% remove 75% of the unused balance.
- If charged usage is less than 10% remove 90% of the unused balance.
