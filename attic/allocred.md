### Second Allocation Reductions Tomorrow

The second allocation reductions will occur **tomorrow**.

The allocation reduction process takes unused allocation from projects not using
them and allows DOE program managers to redistribute that time to other 
projects. PIs and PI proxies may request exemptions, at least one week before 
the reduction date. 

For more information, including how much allocation will be removed, please see
