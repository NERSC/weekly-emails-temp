### New Cray Hyperparameter Optimization Tool for Machine Learning Now Available

Are you interested in using NERSC resources for machine learning model selection
and hyperparameter tuning? Cray has made their new Cray-HPO library for 
hyperparameter optimization available to our users. Cray-HPO integrates easily 
with Cori and provides popular optimization algorithms like random search, grid 
search, genetic search, and population based training, with more features being 
added for future releases. 

To get started with using the tools, please see our documentation page:
<https://docs.nersc.gov/analytics/machinelearning/hpo/>.
See also the presentation on hyperparameter optimization and Cray-HPO from our 
[SC19 Deep Learning at Scale tutorial](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KJm08Ry4qJXOl19MAu2Ao1t_fRNaMwZn?usp=sharing).

Please submit a help desk ticket if you have any issues or questions.
