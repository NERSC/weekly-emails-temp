## Register Now for Edison to KNL Training this Wednesday! 

NERSC will hold a half-day training event aimed at users who depend primarily
on Edison this Wednesday, December 12, 2018, from 9:00-11:30 am (Pacific). The
aim is to provide users who have not yet moved their workflows from Edison to
the KNL nodes on Cori with the knowledge to do so. The training session will
begin with an overview of the differences between Edison and the Cori KNL 
nodes, followed by an overview of compiling and running jobs, and ending with
some time for questions and hands-on work with NERSC staff.

The training will also be beneficial to users who are interested in 
transitioning from the Haswell nodes to the KNL nodes. We recommend that users 
who rely primarily on the Haswell nodes determine whether this transition is
possible for even a small fraction of their workflow, because the 
already-crowded queues for Haswell nodes are likely to become even more 
congested after Edison is decommissioned.

It's not too late to sign up to attend virtually via Zoom technology. For
more information and to register to attend, please see
