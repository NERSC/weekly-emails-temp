## Update on Maintenance Impacting MFA this Thursday

A network maintenance will be performed for approximately 15 minutes on
Thursday, December 6, within the 6:00-6:30 pm (Pacific) window. Users should
experience no noticeable impact as the system are designed to continue
operating during maintenances like these.  Meanwhile, we will be monitoring for
any problems, and users should alert us immediately if they have any issues.

On Friday, NERSC sent a message indicating that could affect NERSC user MFA. As 
we learned more about the plans surrounding the maintenance, we no longer 
foresee a significant impact to users during the maintenance.
