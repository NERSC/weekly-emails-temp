### Cori "Compile" Queue Now Available to All Users

The "compile" QOS on Cori is now open to all users! The 
[compile QOS](https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#compile) is intended for 
workflows that regularly compile codes from source, e.g., DevOps models 
leveraging Continuous Integration. There is a single Cori Haswell node allocated
to compile QOS jobs, and there is no charge for these jobs.
