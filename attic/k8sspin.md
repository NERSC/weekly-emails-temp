### New Kubernetes-Based Spin Instance Now Available for Early Access

Spin is a container-based platform at NERSC designed for you to deploy your own 
science gateways, workflow managers, databases, API endpoints, and other network
services to support your scientific projects.

Early access is now available to a new instance of Spin based on the popular 
Kubernetes system.

Current Spin users may request access by submitting a NERSC ticket, indicating:

`I'm a current Spin user and would like access to Rancher 2.

New Spin users may apply to attend one of several upcoming workshops.
