### NERSC Power Outage Tomorrow through the End of Week!

NERSC will not be operational for the remainder of the week. The NERSC
[website](https://www.nersc.gov) and 
[documentation site](https://docs.nersc.gov) will remain up as they have no 
local dependencies, but the remainder of NERSC systems and services will be 
brought down tomorrow and remain unavailable for the rest of the week. For more
details, please see the entry on the [outage schedule](#powerupgrade) below.

Full NERSC operations (under shelter-in-place) will resume next Monday,
December 21.
