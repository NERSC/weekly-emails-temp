### CUDA Training Series Concludes This Thursday, September 17

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The ninth and final training in the series, to be held this Thursday, September 
17, covers cooperative groups -- a flexible model for thread synchronization 
both within and across thread blocks, which enables the writing of a wide range 
of parallel algorithms in a composable and well-defined manner.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
