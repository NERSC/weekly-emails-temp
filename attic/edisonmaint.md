## Edison Maintenance on Wednesday

Edison will undergo its monthly maintenance this Wednesday, June 27.

The maintenance will now begin at 7:00 am Pacific and conclude at or before 7:00
pm the same day. During this time, the Edison login nodes, compute nodes, and 
scratch system will be unavailable to users. 

For information about why these maintenances take so much longer than a 
comparable operation on your laptop computer, please listen to the interview 
with NERSC system administrator James Botts at
