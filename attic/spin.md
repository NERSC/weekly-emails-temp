## Learn to Use Spin to Build Science Gateways at NERSC: Apply for SpinUp Training

Spin is a new service platform at NERSC based on Docker container technology. It
can be used to deploy web sites and science gateways, workflow managers,
databases and key-value stores, and all sorts of other network services that can
access NERSC systems and storage on the back end.

Spin is currently in a pilot phase and nearly ready for users. **Completion of the
SpinUp training program is required for access**, and applications are now open
for the first sessions to begin in mid-May. **Because SpinUp is hands-on and
interactive, space will be limited**.

Participants in SpinUp will attend three hands-on sessions and complete
take-home lessons to learn about the Spin platform, create running
services, and learn maintenance and troubleshooting techniques. Local and remote
participants are welcome.

Applications close **today**.
