## Submissions Close Friday for August 2019 ECP/NERSC OpenMP Hackathon!

Are you looking to improve your code performance on next-generation hardware? Do
you want to port your code to energy-efficient systems but feel that you need 
the help experienced professionals to help you get started? Apply to the August
2019 OpenMP Hackathon!

NERSC, in collaboration with the ECP SOLLVE and Training Projects, is hosting 
a 3.5-day OpenMP Hackathon at NERSC the week of August 27-30, 2019. Hackathons
pair coding teams with related computational experts to push HPC codes to the 
next level in an intensive and highly collaborative environment. Learn more 
about how hackathons work on a recent NERSC User News
[podcast](https://anchor.fm/nersc-news/episodes/Community-GPU-Hackathon-Kevin-Gott-Interview-e3s408/a-adsmir).

This Hackathon will focus on porting, optimizing, and evolving applications for
energy-efficient processor architectures, especially Intel Xeon Phi (KNL). In
addition, NERSC welcomes application teams interested in using the OpenMP
offload model (no matter their current programming model).
ECP coding teams and teams who plan on running on Cori and Perlmutter are 
especially encouraged to apply, but all code teams serious about working on 
OpenMP for energy-efficient systems will be considered. Get more information and
apply by visiting

Applications close this Friday, June 28.
