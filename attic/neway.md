## New Allocation Year Begins Tomorrow

The 2020 Allocation Year (AY) begins tomorrow. Several changes will take effect 
in the new AY. Of note:
- The [software environment defaults](#corisw) will change, as outlined in the 
[NERSC CDT Policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/Cray-PE-CDT-policy/);
- The default linking mode changes to [dynamic](#dynamic) (from static);
- The default Python module will point to a version of Python 3;
- The new Community File System (CFS) will replace the Project File System;
- Charge factors will change from 90 for any node type to 140 for Haswell
nodes and 80 for KNL nodes;
- NERSC will have a new software policy, providing more clarity on how we
support software on Cori and future machines.
