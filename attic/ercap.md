### 2021 ERCAP Allocations Process Closes TODAY, October 5!

The ERCAP allocations process has now begun accepting requests for the 2021
Allocation Year (AY). Requests will be accepted **through 11:59 pm (Pacific

The majority of NERSC resources and compute time are allocated through the
[ERCAP process](https://www.nersc.gov/users/accounts/allocations/2021-call-for-proposals-to-use-nersc-resources/).
Proposals are reviewed and awarded by Office of Science allocation managers and 
implemented by NERSC. For more information on the ERCAP process, please listen
