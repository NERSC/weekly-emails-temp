### New NERSC Cray Programming Environment/CDT Policy

NERSC has updated its Cray Programming Environment/Cray Developer Toolkit
(PE/CDT) policy. We have decided to change default software versions once per 
year, at the start of the allocation year only. Exceptions to the policy include
major operating system upgrades and critical security flaws or software bugs.

Read the policy at <https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/CDT-policy/>.
