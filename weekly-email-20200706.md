## NERSC Status <a name="section1"/></a> ##

### Normal NERSC Operations Continue During California Phase 2 Period <a name="curtailment"/></a> 

Berkeley Lab, where NERSC is housed, is located in Alameda County, California 
which remains under a Public Health Shelter-in-Place Order that has been
slightly loosened. Under this Order, NERSC may continue to remain open while
following site-specific protection plans. We remain in operation as before,
with the majority of NERSC staff working remotely and only a skeleton crew 
onsite.

During this period, you can continue to expect regular online consulting and 
account support but no telephone support. Trainings will continue to be held 
online, or postponed if online is infeasible. Regular maintenances on the 
systems will continue to be performed while minimizing onsite staff presence, 
which could result in longer downtimes than would occur under normal 
circumstances.

Because onsite staffing is so minimal, we request that you refrain from
calling NERSC Operations except to report urgent system issues.

### Power Upgrade & Outage of NERSC Resources Begins on Friday <a name="powerupgrade"/></a> 

To make the improvements required for Perlmutter, NERSC will take two
machine room power outages this year. The first one, a three-day weekend outage,
is scheduled for this weekend, July 10-14. An additional, shorter, outage will 
be scheduled for late August or September.

These two outages are necessary prerequisites for the installation of
Perlmutter, the first stage of which is expected to arrive at the end of the
year.

Note that we had originally allocated four days for this week's outage; however,
thanks to some process improvements we were able to reduce the power outage to
only three days.

The electrical power upgrade will be performed from this Saturday to Monday,
July 13. In preparation for it we will shut down all NERSC resources beginning 
on Friday, July 10. Power will be restored on or before Tuesday, July 14, at
which point we will perform a Cori maintenance. **You can expect for Cori and
the majority of NERSC resources to be unavailable from 6:00 am (Pacific time)
this Friday, July 10, to 11:59 pm on Tuesday, July 14.**

## Updates at NERSC  <a name="section3"/></a> ##

### Videos from June New Users Training Now Available <a name="newuservideos"/></a> 

Did you miss the new users training last month? Are you interested in brushing
up on the basics about NERSC?

The training for new users presented on June 16 was recorded, and videos
from the training are now available. To view the playlist on YouTube, please
visit 
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20S5EeApOSsFDfNrshVdiaQKZK4CNFq7>.


### Help Testing New Portal Platform Requested <a name="portalmigrate"/></a> 

The science gateway service <https://portal.nersc.gov/> ("portal") is migrating 
to NERSC's container-as-a-service platform, Spin. NERSC staff already have 
created a version of portal in Spin that duplicates the old virtual 
machine-based service. This new prototype seems to be functioning properly and 
serving the same content as the original.

We need help from our users to finish verifying that the prototype is working 
properly before we take it live. If you have never used portal or never heard of
it, you can stop reading here. But if you have ever placed content at 
`/global/cfs/cdirs/<project>/www` you may want to participate. The procedure for
testing the prototype portal service takes only a few minutes, and is outlined 
here:
<https://docs.nersc.gov/services/science-gateways/#special-notice-help-us-test-the-new-portalnerscgov>

The migration is expected to take effect July 31.


### New Default Location for Modulefiles: Please Test <a name="modulepath"/></a> 

In accordance with NERSC's new 
[software policy](https://docs.nersc.gov/policies/software-policy/)
we are moving the location of NERSC-provided modulefiles from 
`/usr/common/software/modulefiles` to: 
- `/global/common/software/nersc/cle7/modulefiles` for "Provided" software, and 
- `/global/common/software/nersc/cle7/extra_modulefiles` for software with 
"Minimal" level support. 

NERSC's previous, ad-hoc software support model corresponds to the new "Minimal"
level, so a copy of all current modulefiles is now available at 
`/global/common/software/nersc/cle7/extra_modulefiles`.

In the upcoming maintenance, we plan to replace 
`/usr/common/software/modulefiles` in the default `MODULEPATH` with 
`/global/common/software/nersc/cle7/modulefiles` and 
`/global/common/software/nersc/cle7/extra_modulefiles`.

This move also allows us to migrate our modulefile version management to 
a GitLab repository supporting modern best practices for software management.

**We do not expect this change to have any visible impact on users or jobs** but
we would like your help testing the change. You can test the new modulepath by
running:
```
module load new-loc
```
and then going about your usual work on the machine.

If you do see unexpected behavior, please let us know by opening a ticket 
at <https://help.nersc.gov>.


### July Maintenance Software Changes; Defaults Remain the Same <a name="prgenv"/></a> 

During this weekend's maintenance, there will be two updates to the software
environment on Cori.

First, we will upgrade the Slurm scheduler from version 19.05.5 to 20.02.3.
The update includes new capabilities designed by NERSC to better integrate
experimental facility workloads. We expect that this will lead to performance 
improvements for some operations by Slurm but will be essentially transparent to
users. One handy new feature is the `--me` flag to the `squeue` command, which
displays a user's own jobs.

Second, we will remove old, non-default software in the Cray programming 
environment and add new, non-default software. The software from CDT/19.06 will 
be removed, and CDT/20.06 will be added. Most users will not notice a change,
because the default Cray programming environment will remain the same.

For more details please see the 
[Programming Environment Change on Cori in July 2020 page](https://docs.nersc.gov/systems/cori/timeline/default_PE_history/2020Jul/) in NERSC's documentation.


### Give Us Your Feedback on Update to "sqs" Script <a name="sqs"/></a> 

The NERSC custom `sqs` script is being simplified to enable better integration
with the native Slurm `squeue` command to display jobs in the queue. The
simplified version is available on Cori under the name `sqs2`, and we encourage
users to try it out and give us feedback. Our plan is to replace `sqs` with
this new script at the maintenance next week.

The `sqs2` command displays a user's jobs in a default format that we believe
displays the most useful information for users. Invoking `sqs2 -a` displays the
jobs of all users. While `sqs2` does not reproduce every feature in the current
`sqs` tool, it is fully compatible with `squeue`, enabling more flexibility in
customizing the output to exactly what a user may want to see.

For more information on using the tool, please see `sqs2 --help`.


### New Kubernetes-Based Spin Instance Now Available for Early Access <a name="k8sspin"/></a> 

Spin is a container-based platform at NERSC designed for you to deploy your own 
science gateways, workflow managers, databases, API endpoints, and other network
services to support your scientific projects.

Early access is now available to a new instance of Spin based on the popular 
Kubernetes system.

Current Spin users may request access by submitting a NERSC ticket, indicating:

`I'm a current Spin user and would like access to Rancher 2.
The NERSC project(s) associated with my use of Spin are ___, ...`

New Spin users may apply to attend one of several upcoming workshops.

See the [Spin web page](https://www.nersc.gov/systems/spin/) to learn more and 
apply!


### Join the NERSC Users Slack Sponsored by NUG Today! <a name="slack"/></a>

## Upcoming Training Events  <a name="section5"/></a> ##

### Learn Performance-Portable Kokkos in Kokkos Lecture Series, Starting July 17 <a name="kokkos"/></a> 

Kokkos is a C++ programming model for performance portability that allows 
developers to implement their applications in a single-source fashion, with
hardware vendor-agnostic programming patterns.

If you've been curious about how to write code with Kokkos, now is your chance!
The Kokkos team is providing its first **Kokkos Lecture Series**, to be held on
Fridays starting July 17 through early September, where attendees learn 
everything necessary to start using Kokkos to write performance-portable code. 
The series consists of a two-hour online lecture every Friday and exercises as 
homework. The team will provide support via GitHub and Slack throughout the 
series.

The series begins on Friday, July 17. **There are a limited number of seats
available, so registration is recommended.** (Please note that although this is 
an ECP-sponsored training, registration is open to all.) For more information 
and to register, please see 
<https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/kokkos-class-series/>.


### Register Today for July 16 Tutorial on Using ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools at NERSC <a name="armtools"/></a> 

Registration is open for the ARM Debugging and Profiling Tools (DDT, MAP, and
Performance Reports) Tutorial that will be held next Thursday, July 16 from
9 am to noon (Pacific time). 

In this interactive, hands-on training, attendees will learn how to efficiently 
use these popular GUI parallel debugging and profiling tools on Cori to analyze 
and improve the functionality and performance of their codes. ARM Forge is an 
integrated environment for debugging (using DDT) and profiling (using MAP)
parallel codes. The Performance Reports tool analyzes the performance of an
application and helps users understand what to do for better application
performance.

We will also show you how the MAP and Performance Reports tools can be used to
profile Python applications for performance optimizations.

Don't forget to bring your own codes to get help from one of the ARM engineers 
on profiling/optimizing them during the hands-on session!

The training will be presented online only, using Zoom technology.

Please see <https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/arm-debugging-and-profiling-tools-tutorial-june-25-2020/>
for the agenda and to register.


### CUDA Training Series Continues July 21 <a name="cudatrain"/></a> 

NVIDIA is presenting a 9-part CUDA training series intended to help new and 
existing GPU programmers understand the main concepts of the CUDA platform and 
its programming model. Each part will include a 1-hour presentation and example 
exercises. The exercises are meant to reinforce the material from the 
presentation and can be completed during a 1-hour hands-on session following 
each lecture via teleconference or on your own. **These events are being held 
exclusively online.**

The seventh training in the series, to be held on Tuesday, July 21, covers 
CUDA concurrency. Concurrency refers to the ability to perform multiple CUDA 
operations simultaneously. Learn about CUDA streams and asynchronous functions 
that can be used to do things like run multiple kernels on a single GPU or 
overlap data transfer and computation.

Following the presentation will be a hands-on session where participants can 
complete example exercises meant to reinforce the presented concepts.
